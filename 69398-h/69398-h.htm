<p>“<span class="smcap">Then</span>, you think Dad really went to
Egypt?” asked Don Sturdy, with deep anxiety
in his tone, as he stood beside the desk where
his uncle, Professor Bruce, was carefully looking
over a mass of papers.</p>

<p>“I’m inclined to think so, my boy,” replied
the professor, as he sat back in his chair and
ran his fingers through his hair. “Everything
seems to point that way, though we haven’t a
bit of positive proof. But we know, at least,
that the idea of going there was in his mind
when he rushed out of Clifton’s house in Brazil
shouting that he must go to Egypt.”</p>

<p>“Still, that may have been the mere whim of
a deranged mind, forgotten almost as soon as
the words were spoken,” put in Captain Frank
Sturdy, another of Don’s uncles, as he turned
from the window through which he had been
looking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>“True enough,” assented the professor.
“But we know from what Ruth told us that
for weeks he had been talking about the Valley
of the Kings in Egypt. It was, I believe, a
fixed idea that had taken possession of him.
And these papers I’ve been looking over explain
why he was so deeply interested in that
country.”</p>

<p>He picked up the heap of manuscript as he
spoke, and selected some papers from the
mass.</p>

<p>“There’s no collected story here,” he remarked;
“simply a lot of memoranda scribbled
on whatever he had at hand, old telegraph
blanks, backs of envelopes, and the like. They
bear upon a trip that Richard took to Egypt
several years ago. The magic of the country
seems to have captivated him. But there’s
something more than the awakened interest of
a tourist in them. They’re aflame with the ardor
of a discoverer. He seems to have been
right on the brink of some remarkable find—so
remarkable, in fact, that he feared to commit it
to paper lest it should get into hands for which
it was not intended.”</p>

<p>“I remember now,” broke in Captain
Sturdy, “that when he got back from that trip
he seemed strangely excited. But I could
never get much out of him about it. He’d talk
about it in a general way, but whenever it came
to details he’d change the subject. I gathered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
that he meant to go back the next year, but the
war came and that put an end to his plans for
the time.”</p>

<p>“He seemed to have spent most of his time
among the tombs,” resumed the professor.
“There is one he mentions that was fifty-two
feet long, thirty-one feet wide, the sides of
which were entirely covered with paintings,
while the roof, twenty-four feet high, was
adorned with a hundred squares of over a
dozen different designs. There’s a diagram of
it here.”</p>

<p>“What do you gather from that?” asked the
captain.</p>

<p>“Nothing much in itself,” was the reply.
“But at the end of the description are the
words: ‘This is not the one. Must look further.’
And there are several other descriptions
of tombs scattered through the papers,
each with this little note of disappointment at
the end. It seems clear to me that Richard
was hunting eagerly for one particular tomb
and desperately anxious to find it.”</p>

<p>“What for, do you suppose?” asked Don.</p>

<p>“What he wanted to find it for or what he
expected to find in it I don’t know. It may
have been gold or scarabs or alabaster vases
or amulets or any of the thousand things that
make some of those tombs veritable treasure
houses. But whatever it was, his mind was
centered on it. It may have become a sort of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
obsession. Then, when his head was hurt in
that accident at the time of the shipwreck,
that one overpowering desire to get back to
Egypt may have come to the front and been
too strong to be resisted.”</p>

<p>“Even if he did go there,” said Don, in perplexity,
“it’s strange that nothing has been
heard of him. He had to live somewhere, must
have registered at some hotel. Yet all the consuls
in the various cities have investigated and
can find no traces of any one named Sturdy.”</p>

<p>“He may have used some other name,” suggested
the professor. “It’s quite possible
that he’d forgotten his own. Cases of amnesia
are common enough, when a man forgets all his
past history, even his name.”</p>

<p>“But if mother had been with him, she’d
have set that all right,” objected Don.</p>

<p>“True enough,” replied the professor. “But
how do we know that she was with him? All
we know is that she ran out after him into the
night. We cannot be sure that he didn’t elude
her.”</p>

<p>“Oh, shall we ever be able to solve the mystery?”
cried Don, in desperation.</p>

<p>“Yes, we will,” declared the captain heartily,
as he placed his hand encouragingly on his
nephew’s shoulder. “Keep up your heart, my
boy. Remember that we found your sister
Ruth when we had almost given up hope. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
with heaven’s help we’ll find your father and
mother too.”</p>

<p>“To be sure we shall, even if we go to Egypt
to do it,” chimed in the professor. “We’ll
rake that country with a fine-toothed comb before
we’ll give up and admit that we’re
beaten.”</p>

<p>The sound of the dinner bell broke up the
conference, and Don hastened to his room to
wash and to brush his hair.</p>

<p>They were served at table by Jennie Jenks,
the maid of all work, who in her flittings to
and fro that afternoon had caught snatches of
the conversation and was bursting with the desire
to impart it to Mrs. Roscoe, the housekeeper
of the Sturdy home.</p>

<p>“I guess we kin say good-bye to Mister Don
an’ his uncles,” she remarked, in one of her
migrations to the kitchen. “They’re all a goin’
to the tomb.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Roscoe was so startled that she nearly
dropped the dish she was carrying from the
oven.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” she gasped. “Are
they sick?”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t think so if you seen the way
they was eatin’,” replied Jennie, shifting her
wad of chewing gum. “I mean they’re goin’
to them Egypt tombs, where they’s alligaster
vases an’ omelets an’ things like that.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you mean the tombs of the Pharaohs,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
said the motherly housekeeper, in great relief.
“They’ve been dead a long time.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe,” admitted Jennie. “Though I
hadn’t even heard they was sick. But it just
beats all the way them men go trampin’ all
over the earth when they got a good home like
this. Here they jest got back from Brazil, an’
lucky they was not to be et up by golcondas or
cannonballs, an’ instead of settlin’ down,
thankful like, they must be goin’ off lickety-switch
to another of them heathen places. Who
knows what’ll happen to ’em? Like as not
Mister Don may fall down into one of them
Egypt tombs an’ be squashed.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess not,” replied the housekeeper
soothingly. “He’s been in a good many tight
places and has come through all right.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” admitted Jennie. “But the picture
that goes to the well too often is broke at last.
An’ it jest makes my blood creep to think of
them goin’ to that Egypt place, where all them
plagues used to be.”</p>

<p>“That was a long time ago,” remarked the
housekeeper. “I guess it’s all right now.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Jennie, renewing her
attack on her chewing gum more vigorously
and shaking her head. “From all I’ve heard,
them Egyptians ain’t any better than they ort
to be.”</p>

<p>“Who is?” asked Mrs. Roscoe mildly.</p>

<p>“A feller took me to a movie once that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
showed all ’bout Egypt,” went on Jennie, ignoring
the question. “The big buildings was
so dark an’ gloomy they give me the shivers.
I ast the feller why they didn’t have electric
lights, an’ he tole me that they didn’t need electric
lights coz they had so many Israelites. I
ast him what they had to do with it, an’ he
only laughed an’ said he loved every bone in
my head.”</p>

<p>“He had a lot to love, then,” put in Mrs.
Roscoe dryly.</p>

<p>“An’ they was a picture of the ocean,” Jennie
continued, oblivious of the sarcasm, “an’
the feller that was with me tole me that was
Pharaoh an’ his chariots an’ the children of
Israel crossing the Red Sea. I said, ‘Where’s
the children of Israel, I don’t see any,’ an’ he
said, ‘Oh, they’ve gone over’; an’ I said, ‘Well,
then, where’s Pharaoh and his chariots?’ an’
he said, ‘Oh, they’ve gone under.’ I s’pose
that was the way of it since he said so, but it
didn’t seem just right somehow.”</p>

<p>Just then Jennie was interrupted by a call
from the dining room and scurried away, saving
the housekeeper the necessity of listening
to any further details for the moment.</p>

<p>Don finished his dinner and then went out
and sat down in a chair on the porch. It was a
beautiful summer evening, and in the great old
trees about the house the birds were singing
their vesper songs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>Ordinarily the charm of the hour would have
appealed to Don, but now the outer peace only
helped to emphasize by contrast the ferment of
anxiety in his mind. Where was his father?
Where was his mother? Were they still alive?
What fate was keeping him without tidings of
his parents, dearer to him than life?</p>

<p>A boy on a motorcycle came at a rapid gait
up the road. Don looked at him listlessly as
he neared, but with quickened interest when
he stopped at the gate.</p>

<p>The messenger opened the gate and wheeled
his machine up the path.</p>

<p>“Cap’n Sturdy in?” asked the boy.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Don. “Want to see him?”</p>

<p>“Got a cablegram for him,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Uncle Frank!” called Don. “Will you step
here a minute? Something for you.”</p>

<p>The captain came to the door, carrying in his
hand the evening newspaper he had been reading.</p>

<p>“What is it?” he asked.</p>

<p>The messenger handed him the envelope he
drew from his pocket. The captain signed for
it and tore it open.</p>

<p>He ran his eyes over the message, and gave
a shout that brought Don to his feet in a
twinkling.</p>

<p>“What is it?” he asked in surprise and some
alarm. “What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“Read it! Read it!” cried the captain, shoving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
the message toward his nephew with a
hand that trembled.</p>

<p>Don looked at it, and started as though he
had received an electric shock.</p>

<p>“It’s from mother!” he cried. “It’s from
mother!”</p>

<p>This was the way the message ran:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Strange disappearance of Richard. Must
have assistance. Cable immediately.</p>

<small><span class="smcap">Like a Voice from the Grave</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">From</span> mother!” shouted Don. “She’s
alive! A cablegram from mother!”</p>

<p>He kissed the precious message and pressed
it to his heart. Happy tears were in his eyes.
The captain was scarcely less stirred.</p>

<p>The commotion brought the professor hurrying
to the porch, as well as Don’s sister Ruth,
who, not yet fully recovered from her long illness,
stood like a frail lily, framed in the doorway.</p>

<p>“What is it, Don?” she asked, clasping her
hands beseechingly. “I heard you say something
about mother? What has happened?”</p>

<p>Don sprang to her side and led her to a
chair, where he seated her tenderly.</p>

<p>“Good news, Ruth, glorious news!” he cried.
“We have a message from mother. She’s
alive! Think of it, Ruth! Mother’s alive and
we’re going to see her soon!”</p>

<p>Ruth’s head drooped on his breast and she
fell into a passion of weeping. They let her
cry to her heart’s content, knowing they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
tears that could bring balm and blessing. The
captain turned away, and the professor, to conceal
his emotion, blew his nose vigorously.</p>

<p>The paroxysm passed, and Ruth, her eyes
shining through her tears, looked at Don.</p>

<p>“What about Dad?” she asked.</p>

<p>Don’s face clouded.</p>

<p>“That news isn’t so good,” he answered.
“Mother says that he has mysteriously disappeared.
But we’ll find him, never fear. And,
anyway, we know that he is still alive—or was
up to within a very short time. When is that
cablegram dated, Uncle Frank?”</p>

<p>“This morning,” answered the captain,
“and it comes from Alexandria. That shows
that they both reached Egypt from Brazil. It’s
probable that Richard has been missing for a
day or two only, or Alice would have cabled
sooner. I wish she had gone more into details.
But those will come later,” he added.</p>

<p>“She has probably been short of money, and
cable tolls are expensive,” suggested the professor.</p>

<p>“We’ll soon settle the money question!” exclaimed
the captain. “Dan,” he called to the
man of all work, who, together with Mrs.
Roscoe and Jenny, had been called out by the
excitement and stood near by, “get out the car
at once and drive me down to the village. I’ll
cable her a thousand dollars to-night, and tell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
her we’re coming to her by the first steamer we
can get.”</p>

<p>Dan hurried away to the garage, while the
captain went into the house to get his hat.</p>

<p>“Come into the house, my blessed lamb,”
said Mrs. Roscoe, her own face wet with happy
tears, as she folded Ruth in her motherly embrace
and led her inside.</p>

<p>“My poor dear Missus!” blubbered Jenny,
as she followed them. “All alone out there in
the land of the Pigamids and the Spinach!”</p>

<p>“I’m going with you, Uncle Frank!” cried
Don, as Dan brought the car up to the door.</p>

<p>“Jump in,” said the captain, as he set the
example. Dan threw in the clutch and the car
whirled out of the gate.</p>

<p>While uncle and nephew are speeding to respond
to that call for help from faraway
Egypt, it may be well, for the benefit of those
who have not read the preceding volumes of
this series, to tell who Don Sturdy was and
what had been his adventures up to the time
this story opens.</p>

<p>Don was a lad of fourteen, unusually tall and
muscular for his age, with brown hair and
eyes and a fair complexion. He had been born
and brought up in Hillville, a thriving town in
an Eastern state, about fifty miles from New
York. The Sturdy house was of stone, as were
the barn, garage and other outbuildings, surrounded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
by several acres of ground set out
with large trees.</p>

<p>Some time before the beginning of the events
here narrated, Don’s father, Richard Sturdy, a
great traveler, had set out on an exploring expedition,
accompanied by his wife, Alice, and
by his daughter, Ruth, who was about two
years younger than Don. No word came from
them, nor did the ship <i>Mercury</i> on which they
had embarked reach port, and with the passage
of time it began to be feared that the <i>Mercury</i>
had gone down with all on board while rounding
Cape Horn. The blow was a terrible one
to Don, who dearly loved his parents and
younger sister, and drove him nearly frantic
with grief.</p>

<p>During his parents’ absence, Don had been
left in the care of his uncle on his father’s side,
Captain Frank Sturdy, his official guardian, a
big game hunter of great repute, whose business
of gathering animals dead and alive for
museums and menageries had taken him at
times all over the world. He was a big man
of iron nerve, sinewy, with black hair and eyes.
He was a dead shot, and his instructions had
made Don also a marksman only second to himself.</p>

<p>Don was also under the general oversight of
Professor Amos Regor Bruce, his uncle on his
mother’s side, and an eminent scientist and
member of many learned societies. He also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
had traveled extensively in the interest of
museums, for whom he gathered rare archæological
specimens.</p>

<p>To divert Don’s mind from dwelling on his
supposed loss, his uncles, both of whom were
bachelors, took him with them on a trip to the
Sahara Desert. There one adventure trod
quickly on the heels of another. Don rescued
a boy of about his own size, Teddy Allison,
from the attack of thievish Arabs. It developed
that Teddy’s father had been captured
and carried into slavery. The sympathies of
Don and his uncles were enlisted by the boy’s
plight, and they organized an auto expedition
into the desert to find Mr. Allison and incidentally
to discover, if they could, the City of
Brass and the Cave of Emeralds. What difficulties
they had to surmount; the encounters
they had with bandits; the thrilling circumstances
attending the rescue of Mr. Allison and
their finding of the emeralds are told in the
first volume of this series, entitled: “Don
Sturdy on the Desert of Mystery; or, Autoing
in the Land of the Caravans.”</p>

<p>Don’s astonishment and delight may be
imagined when he learned from Mr. Allison
that, though the <i>Mercury</i> had indeed been
shipwrecked, a number of passengers on the
ill-fated ship had been picked up by a sailing
vessel and carried to Brazil. Teddy’s father
had heard the story from others of the rescued<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
party, a scientist and a sailor, who were presumably
somewhere in Brazil, though he did
not know their exact whereabouts. Don’s
hopes that his parents and sister might have
been among the survivors were revived, and he
and his uncles determined to go to that great
South American country, a project rendered
the easier by the fact that the captain had a
contract to capture big snakes and the professor
wished to go to the same region to
search for rare drugs.</p>

<p>Before long their expedition was organized
and they had plunged into the wilds of Brazil.
Here they had the most exciting adventures
with anacondas, boa constrictors, alligators
and jaguars, and were many times in peril of
their lives.</p>

<p>How they captured the hideous monsters of
the jungle; how they followed up traces of
Don’s parents and sister and finally found
Ruth in a hospital and brought her back to
America; how they were baffled by the perplexing
mystery that still clung about the movements
of Don’s father and mother, are fully
narrated in the second volume of this series,
entitled: “Don Sturdy with the Big Snake
Hunters; or, Lost in the Jungles of the Amazon.”</p>

<p>Now to return to Don, as, with his heart
thumping against his ribs with joy and excitement,
he accompanied his uncle to Hillville in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
order to send the message that would bring relief
and assurance to his mother’s heart.</p>

<p>Cable tolls were a matter of no consequence
to the captain, and he sent a long message to
his sister-in-law, full of love and sympathy and
encouragement, accompanied by a telegraphic
order for a thousand dollars and directions to
draw on him for all she needed to any amount.
He told her also that Ruth was safe at home,
and that he and the professor and Don would
be on their way to her by the first steamer on
which they could secure passage.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s that!” exclaimed the captain,
when he had finished and again climbed into
the car. “Now to be up at daybreak and on my
way to New York to make arrangements for
our passage. You’ve got to hustle now, my
boy, to get ready.”</p>

<p>“Ready?” cried Don. “I’m ready now. I’d
like to start off this minute.”</p>

<p>“So should I,” replied his uncle. “But a
trip half-way around the world can’t be taken
at the drop of a hat. We’ll make things hum
though, you can be sure of that.”</p>

<p>“How long will the voyage take?”</p>

<p>“Three weeks, probably. Possibly a little
less if we make good connections. We’ll have
to go to England first, and book passage on a
liner from there. But they run frequently,
and we won’t have long to wait.”</p>

<p>It was getting dark as they drew near the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
Sturdy home. In the dusk Don saw two figures
walking by the side of the road whom he recognized
at once. He called to Dan to stop, and
the car halted abreast of them.</p>

<p>“Hello, Emily! Hello, Fred!” Don called
out. “Jump in. Where are you going?”</p>

<p>“Just coming over to make you a little call,”
replied Fred Turner, a boy of about Don’s own
age.</p>

<p>“Better and better!” exclaimed Don. “Get
in. I have some glorious news, and if I don’t
tell it to some one I’ll burst!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<small><span class="smcap">Off for Egypt</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">It</span> would be too bad to have anything like
that happen, Don,” was the laughing reply of
Fred, as he helped his sister into the car and
followed her. “So fire away and let’s have it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you don’t mean, Don, that you’ve heard
from your parents?” asked Emily eagerly. “I
can’t imagine anything else that would make
you so happy.”</p>

<p>“It’s just that!” declared Don jubilantly.
“Got a cablegram from my mother. She’s in
Egypt, and we’re going right over there to get
her and bring her home.”</p>

<p>Emily gave a little squeal of delight and
Fred grabbed Don’s hand with a fervor that
made him wince.</p>

<p>“Glory hallelujah!” cried Fred. “Isn’t
that splendid!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Don, I’m so glad and thankful!” exclaimed
Emily. “Now Ruth will get well in a
hurry. It’s just that awful worry that’s made
her so weak and ill. How did she take it?”</p>

<p>“Too happy for words,” replied Don. “It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
will do her more good than all the tonics and
medicines in the world.”</p>

<p>“Your father is with your mother, I suppose,”
remarked Fred.</p>

<p>“No,” replied Don slowly, his tone tinctured
with soberness. “That’s the one bad thing in
the news. He’s disappeared, and mother
doesn’t know where he is. We’re going over
to hunt him up. But at least we know that he
was alive nearly up to the time she cabled, and
that’s a whole lot in itself.”</p>

<p>By this time the car had reached the house.
Captain Sturdy went inside to discuss the coming
trip with Professor Bruce. Don and Fred
sat down on the porch, while Emily rushed inside
to rejoice with Ruth over her new-found
happiness.</p>

<p>Fred and Emily Turner were orphans, who
lived at a little distance from the Sturdy home.
Their first acquaintance with Don dated from
the time just before his journey to Brazil when
Don had saved Emily from a raging torrent
into which she had fallen. Fred at that time
was badly crippled, so badly, in fact, that his
recovery seemed hopeless. The orphans were
also in bad financial circumstances, and the
small estate in stocks and bonds that had been
left them by their father had been taken from
them by a heartless swindler.</p>

<p>A warm friendship sprang up between Don
and the young folks, and the former enlisted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
the help of his uncles in their behalf. The story
of what was done for the Turners by Professor
Bruce and Captain Sturdy and how Fred was
cured of his lameness and made as strong and
well as other lads of his age has been narrated
in the preceding volume.</p>

<p>Don and Fred had been chatting for a few
minutes on the porch when the telephone bell
rang. Don excused himself and went inside
to answer it.</p>

<p>“Hello!” came the call. “Is that you, Don?
This is Brick.”</p>

<p>“Bully!” cried Don, as he realized that his
caller was Teddy Allison, nicknamed Brick because
of his mop of fiery red hair. “I’ve been
wondering why I hadn’t heard from you.”</p>

<p>“Been plugging away at my books,” growled
Brick. “But vacation will be here in a few
days now, and I’m going to make tracks to
Hillville just as soon as I can get away. I’m
crazy to hear all about your trip to Brazil.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t been any crazier than I’ve
been to have you come,” replied Don. “But,
Brick, old boy, I’m afraid I won’t be here when
your vacation begins. I’m going to Egypt.”</p>

<p>There was an exclamation at the other end
of the wire as though Brick had been stunned.
Don went on to explain the good news he had
received and Teddy was overjoyed.</p>

<p>“It’s glorious, Don!” he said. “It’s the
best news I’ve heard in months. But, say, Don,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
if you’re going to Egypt, why can’t I go
along?”</p>

<p>“That would be great,” responded Don enthusiastically.
“I’d be tickled to death. And
I’m sure my uncles would have no objection.
You know what they think of you. They think
you’re about the finest boy that ever wore
shoes. But how about your father? Would he
be willing to have you go?”</p>

<p>“He isn’t in New York, worse luck,” replied
Brick. “He’s gone out West on a business
matter. But I’ll try to get him by telegraph or
long distance ’phone. Oh, Don, I’ve just got
to go with you! I’ll go if I have to swim!”</p>

<p>“Pretty long swim,” laughed Don. “But do
your best, old boy, and I’ll talk to my uncles;
though I’m sure they’ll be willing.”</p>

<p>The boys talked for a few minutes longer,
and then Don hung up the receiver and rejoined
Fred on the porch.</p>

<p>“From Brick Allison,” he explained. “He’s
wild to go with us to Egypt.”</p>

<p>“I don’t wonder,” commented Fred. “But
now, Don,” he went on, rising as Emily came
out on the porch, “I guess we’d better go, for
I know you’ll have a thousand things to do in
getting ready for your trip on such short notice.”</p>

<p>The next few days were busy ones. Clothes
suitable for the hot climate of Egypt had to be
bought, arrangements made for letters of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
credit, passages booked on the steamer, and a
host of other details attended to that had to
be crowded into their hurried preparations.</p>

<p>The captain and professor kept the wires
hot in their calls on the various shipping offices,
and were delighted to find that they could get
passage on a steamer going directly to Alexandria
in Egypt, thus obviating the necessity
of going to England first, an arrangement that
would save them several days. At a time when
every day counted, this was an item of prime
importance.</p>

<p>No answering cable had come from Mrs.
Sturdy, a fact that increased their uneasiness
and gave an added intensity to their longing
to be off.</p>

<p>Nor had Teddy ’phoned again, except once
to tell Don that he was trying frantically to get
in touch with his father but had not yet succeeded.
But no other message followed, and
Don was forced reluctantly to give up hope of
his boy friend taking the trip with him.</p>

<p>The day came at last when they were to go
to New York, there to board the <i>Cleopatra</i>, the
vessel on which their passage was booked.
There were tender partings from Ruth, in
whose cheeks the roses were again coming
from the knowledge that her mother was alive.
They promised to keep in frequent touch with
her by cable.</p>

<p>There were warm good wishes also from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
Dan and Mrs. Roscoe and Jenny. The hired
girl’s agitated feelings were revealed by the
unusual vigor with which she chewed her gum.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Mister Don,” she whimpered.
“Don’t get trompled by no cambles an’ don’t
get et by no crockumdiles an’ don’t fall down
in none of them Egypt tombs.”</p>

<p>Don promised that he would be careful, and
the party stepped into the car and were driven
down by Dan to the station, where they took
the train to New York.</p>

<p>The <i>Cleopatra</i> was to sail the next morning
at eleven, and two hours earlier Don and his
uncles went on board. The ship was new and
well equipped, their staterooms were favorably
located and satisfactorily furnished, and to all
appearance they would have a comfortable
and, they hoped, a speedy voyage.</p>

<p>Don quickly arranged his belongings in his
cabin and then went out on deck, which was
humming with the activity always prevailing
on a steamer on the point of sailing. He hung
over the rail looking eagerly for one particular
face among the many that thronged the pier.
In his last talk with Teddy he had told him of
the steamer he would take and the day and
hour of sailing, and he confidently expected
that his chum would be on hand to see him off.</p>

<p>But Teddy did not appear, and when at last
the gangplank was drawn in and the great vessel
edged her way out into the river, Don turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
away with a feeling of disappointment. What
on earth had kept his friend from being on
hand? It was not like Teddy to fail him in
anything.</p>

<p>But though a sore spot remained in his heart,
the first days of the voyage were full of interesting
things to engross his attention. The
weather was fine, and he spent most of the time
on deck, enjoying the cool breezes, the never
ending fascination of the ocean, and studying
his fellow passengers.</p>

<p>These last embraced more varied types than
usual, because many of them were natives of
countries that bordered on the Mediterranean
and were clad in the picturesque garb of their
various lands. There were many Greeks, Algerians,
Tunisians and Egyptians, the latter of
whom were of special interest because of the
preëminent place that Egypt held in his
thoughts.</p>

<p>Three whose dress proclaimed that they belonged
to the land of the Nile particularly attracted
his notice.</p>

<p>One was an elderly man of benevolent expression,
with deep piercing eyes peering out
from beneath shaggy eyebrows. He seemed a
sage and a scholar, rich in wisdom and experience.
Don instinctively liked him without
exactly knowing why. His name, as the boy ascertained
from one of the deck stewards, was
Zata Phalos.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>Two other Egyptians, who, as Don learned
from the same source, bore the names of Tezra
and Nepahak, aroused in Don a feeling of suspicion
and distrust. They were always together,
and usually conversing in low tones, as
though fearing to be overheard. From glances
they cast frequently at Phalos, accompanied
by a vindictive glitter, Don judged that the latter
was the subject of their conversation.</p>

<p>Tezra was tall and stoop-shouldered, while
Nepahak was fat, short and oily. Don noticed
that Tezra did most of the talking, while
Nepahak assented by nods or objected in monosyllables.
Tezra was apparently the dominant
character of the two. To Don, the faces of both
bore the stamp of evil.</p>

<p>“Those birds will bear watching,” Don muttered
to himself. “I’d hate to be at their mercy
if they had an object in injuring me.”</p>

<p>On the third afternoon out Don noticed a
certain confusion about one of the hatchways.
A number of the crew seemed to be hauling
about rather roughly a figure that was obscured
by the crowd.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Don of a steward
who came hurrying past him.</p>

<p>“They’ve nabbed a stowaway,” was the
reply.</p>

<p>“Poor fellow,” thought Don. He knew that
a stowaway was about as popular with a ship’s
officers and crew as a rattlesnake at a picnic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
party. “I suppose they’ll make him work out
his passage in the stokehole for the rest of the
voyage.”</p>

<p>Just then a petty officer came up to where
Don was seated in his deck chair between those
occupied by the captain and the professor.</p>

<p>“Beg pardon, sir,” he said, addressing the
captain, “but we have a stowaway there who
insists on seeing the Sturdys and Professor
Bruce. Just sheer impudence, I suppose, but
I thought I’d tell you, sir.”</p>

<p>Don and his uncles looked at each other in
astonishment.</p>

<p>“What on earth can that mean?” cried the
captain, jumping to his feet and striding toward
the hatchway, closely followed by Don
and the professor.</p>

<p>The crowd opened as they approached, and
their astounded eyes fell on—Teddy Allison!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small><span class="smcap">A Pair of Scoundrels</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Brick</span>!” cried Don, scarcely daring to believe
his eyes.</p>

<p>“Teddy Allison!” ejaculated Captain
Sturdy, in a tone that conveyed sternness as
well as astonishment.</p>

<p>“Bless my soul!” exclaimed Professor
Bruce, staring hard at the stowaway, as though
wondering whether it was Teddy in the flesh or
his ghost.</p>

<p>But it was a very substantial Teddy that
stood before them, held in the grip of two of
the sailors, his clothes rumpled and disheveled,
smears of dirt across his face, his uncombed
red hair flaming above his pale features.</p>

<p>His eyes had lighted with joy as they looked
at Don, but fell sheepishly before the gravity
that had replaced astonishment in the eyes of
the captain and the professor.</p>

<p>Don leaped forward impulsively and threw
his arm over Brick’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“You sure had me going for a minute,
Brick,” he said. “You could have knocked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
me down with a feather. But I can’t tell you
how glad I am to see you here.”</p>

<p>The evident acquaintance of the Sturdys and
Professor Bruce with the stowaway caused the
sailors to relinquish their hold of Teddy’s collar,
and just at that moment one of the officers
of the ship came along to look into the matter.</p>

<p>Captain Sturdy addressed him.</p>

<p>“You needn’t worry about this boy, officer,”
he said. “His father is a friend of mine. I’ll
take all responsibility for him and pay his
passage.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, sir, certainly,” replied the officer.
“That will be all right. Hardly know
where we’ll find accommodation for him
though. All our staterooms are taken.”</p>

<p>“He can share the cabin of my nephew,” replied
the captain. “Come, Teddy,” he went
on, addressing the culprit. “Don will take you
to his room and fit you out with some of his
clothes after you’ve had a bath. Then I’ll
have something to say to you, young man.”</p>

<p>There was something in Captain Sturdy’s
tone and glance that was not at all reassuring
to the aforesaid young man, who hurried away
with Don, glad to get away from the half-wondering,
half-amused glances of the passengers
who had been summoned by the hubbub.</p>

<p>“Gee, Don, I suppose I’m in for an awful
scolding,” Teddy whispered to his chum, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
he watched the uncompromising back of the
captain.</p>

<p>“Shouldn’t wonder, old boy,” laughed Don.
“You’ll probably get an earful. But, after all,
Uncle Frank won’t eat you. And, at any rate,
you’re here, and nothing else matters much.
You won’t get any scolding from me, that’s a
cinch. You look mighty good to me, Brick.
I’m crazy to hear what’s happened to you since
the ship sailed.”</p>

<p>“It’s a long story, mates,” replied the grinning
Teddy, whose mercurial spirits began to
rise, despite the lecture in store for him. “But
first let me get rid of some of this grime and
slip into some decent clothes. Then I’ll feel
like a civilized human being again. Gee, there’s
no hobo has anything on me.”</p>

<p>So Don forbore to question his friend further,
and busied himself in getting out some of
his clothes, while Teddy splashed about in the
bathtub.</p>

<p>Teddy had scarcely finished dressing when
there came a knock on the door. Don opened
it, and the captain and the professor entered.</p>

<p>“Now, young man,” said the captain, as they
seated themselves, “perhaps you can explain
your action in running away from home and
stowing yourself away on this ship. It goes
without saying that your father knew nothing
about it.”</p>

<p>The tone was cold and the look that went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
with it seemed to bore Teddy through and
through and demand the truth. Not that Teddy
thought of telling anything else. Falsehood
was not one of his vices.</p>

<p>His face flushed almost as red as his hair as
he fidgeted about, nervously clasping and unclasping
his fingers.</p>

<p>“I—I—meant to tell my father,” he stammered.
“I tried to find out where he was. I
wrote and telegraphed and telephoned. But
he was going from one place to another, and,
somehow, I couldn’t get in touch with him.”</p>

<p>“Well?” said the captain, as Teddy paused.</p>

<p>“Then,” confessed Teddy. “I got desperate
to think of Don going to Egypt without me,
and I made up my mind to go anyway and tell
my father about it afterward.”</p>

<p>“Afterward!” repeated the captain, with a
sarcasm that was not lost on its object. “So
you think it’s all right to do things like this
and ask your father’s permission when it’s too
late for him to say no?”</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose it was just right,” admitted
Teddy. “But I was sure he would let
me go if he knew about it. When I wanted to
go with Don to Brazil and he wouldn’t let me,
he half promised that I could go along if Don
made another trip. And it isn’t as though I
hadn’t tried to get his permission,” he added,
in the hope of softening Captain Sturdy’s
heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>“That would have made it worse,” conceded
the captain. “All the same, that is no excuse
for doing as you did. Undoubtedly your father
will be greatly worried when he comes home
and finds you gone.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I took care of that!” exclaimed Teddy,
snatching eagerly at any redeeming feature.
“I left a letter for my father with one of the
servants, telling him all about it. He’ll know
I am with you and that you will take good care
of me.”</p>

<p>The calm assurance of this almost took the
captain’s breath away, and a smile came to
the professor’s lips that he repressed instantly.</p>

<p>“And of course father will pay you for any
expense I am to you,” said Teddy, who had
caught the professor’s smile and took heart of
hope from it.</p>

<p>The captain pondered for a moment.</p>

<p>“You did very wrong, Teddy,” he said
gravely. “No boy has a right to take such a step
as that without his father’s consent. If I could,
I would send you back at once. But that is impossible.
At the first stopping place, I will cable
to your father and get his directions in the matter.
In the meantime, of course, you are one of
our party. I am very much displeased with
you.”</p>

<p>With this Parthian shot, the captain left the
cabin, followed by the professor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>Teddy wiped the perspiration from his face
and looked at Don.</p>

<p>“Gee, he did give it to me good and plenty,”
he said, as he sank down on the bed. “I feel
as though I’d been drawn through a knothole.
And at that, I know that everything he said was
right.”</p>

<p>“Everything that Uncle Frank says is
right,” declared Don loyally. “But tell me
now, Brick, just how you managed to get on
board and stow yourself away. Here I was,
sore as a pup because you didn’t come down to
see me off, and you’ve been right on the ship
with us all the time.”</p>

<p>“I came down to the ship the night before she
sailed,” explained Teddy. “It was dark, and
I slipped on board when no one was looking
and hid away in one of the lifeboats. I didn’t
mean then—anyway, I didn’t more than half
mean—to be a stowaway. I told myself that
I’d see you and your uncles when you came on
in the morning and beg them to take me with
them. I knew I wouldn’t have to beg you,” he
added, with a grin.</p>

<p>“You bet you wouldn’t,” laughed Don. “I
couldn’t have said yes quick enough.”</p>

<p>“But while I was hiding in the lifeboat I had
plenty of time for thinking,” went on Teddy;
“and the more I thought, the surer I got that
your uncles wouldn’t do it without my father’s
knowledge.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>“You were dead right there!”</p>

<p>“But I was crazy to go,” resumed Teddy,
“and I decided that the only way I could go
was to stow myself away so that I couldn’t
be found until after the vessel sailed. The
lifeboat didn’t seem safe enough, for all that
any one walking around would have to do would
be to lift the tarpaulin covering and spy me.</p>

<p>“So I waited till after midnight and watched
my chance and slipped down one of the open
hatchways into the hold. There were hundreds
of bales and barrels there, and it was easy to
find a place where nobody would have a chance
of finding me.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you come out sooner?” asked
Don, in wonderment. “This is the third day
that we’ve been sailing.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t,” was the reply. “I found it was
easier to get in than it was to get out. I’d have
come out after the first day if I could. But it
was only this afternoon that a sailor came
down in the hold for something, and I yelled to
him. You ought to have heard the howl he let
out. Guess he thought it was a ghost at first.
Then he came for me. Oh, I got out on deck
quick enough then—pulled up by the scruff of
my neck.”</p>

<p>“Were you hurt?” asked Don quickly.</p>

<p>“He didn’t actually hit me,” replied Teddy;
“but he twisted his knuckles in my neck till
I thought I’d choke. I guess sailors feel toward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
stowaways something as brakemen feel
about hoboes stealing rides on railroad trains.
As soon as I could get my breath, I asked for
the Sturdy party; and you know the rest.”</p>

<p>“How did you get along for grub?” asked
Don. “Did you have any with you?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit,” was the answer. “You see,
when I first came on board I counted on seeing
you the next morning, really, so I didn’t bring
anything along with me. After I’d been down
in the hold awhile I began to feel hungry.
Then I got scared for fear I’d starve to death.
But I rustled around among the boxes and
barrels and found some boxes where the covers
had been cracked or loosened and got hold of
some canned goods, beef and preserved cherries.
I broke the cans open on the sharp edge
of a box. But, oh, boy, what I’m going to do
to the grub when I once get at a regular table!”</p>

<p>“There goes the gong now,” said Don, rising.
“Come right along and fill up.”</p>

<p>“Lead me to it!” cried Teddy, jumping up.</p>

<p>What he did to the fare of the liner’s table
amply fulfilled his prediction. Even the silent
disapproval that still persisted on the faces of
the captain and the professor had no effect on
his appetite.</p>

<p>“Does it beat canned beef and cherries?”
whispered the grinning Don, who was sitting
beside him.</p>

<p>“By a thousand miles,” replied Teddy, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
clearly as he could with his mouth full. “I’ve
already let out my belt twice.”</p>

<p>They had reached the dessert when Teddy
gave a start. His eyes had fallen on the faces
of two of his fellow passengers, seated at a
table a few feet away.</p>

<p>“Who are those fellows?” he asked, in an
agitated whisper.</p>

<p>Don followed the direction of his glance.</p>

<p>“They’re Egyptians,” he answered. “Their
names are Tezra and Nepahak. Why do you
ask?”</p>

<p>“They’re rascals!” declared Teddy emphatically.</p>

<small><span class="smcap">A Villainous Plot</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Don</span> looked at Teddy in surprise.</p>

<p>“How do you know those men are rascals?”
he asked. “I don’t like the looks of them myself,
but I hadn’t heard anything against
them.”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard plenty,” rejoined Teddy. “And
from their own lips, though they didn’t know
I heard them.”</p>

<p>“Spill it,” urged Don impatiently.</p>

<p>“Wait till I finish this pie,” replied Teddy.
“That’s the most important thing I have to do
just now.”</p>

<p>He kept on imperturbably, while Don waited
in a fever of curiosity.</p>

<p>“Come across now,” said Don, when Teddy
had finished the last crumb.</p>

<p>“That pie’s mighty good,” remarked Teddy,
as he signaled the waiter to bring him another
piece.</p>

<p>“I’ve seen anacondas eat,” said Don disgustedly.
“But you have it all over them.”</p>

<p>“That’s because they never tasted pie as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
good as this,” remarked Teddy complacently.</p>

<p>He finished his second helping, and then
looked around for the waiter.</p>

<p>“No you don’t!” exclaimed Don, jumping
up and grabbing Teddy by the arm. “Come
along now, or there’ll be a famine on board
this ship.”</p>

<p>“I never thought you had such a mean disposition,”
remarked the grinning Teddy, resigning
himself, nevertheless, and followed his
friend out on the deck.</p>

<p>“Now, if you want to live another minute,”
said Don, when they had ensconced themselves
comfortably in deck chairs, “tell me what you
mean about those fellows.”</p>

<p>“They came along the night I was hiding in
the lifeboat,” replied Teddy. “There was nobody
else around that part of the deck, and
they sat down within a few feet of me and began
to talk. They kept their voices low and
they talked in their own language, so that they
felt pretty safe. But you know I picked up
a good deal of Arabic while I was living in
Algiers; so, though there was some difference,
I could understand almost all they said.</p>

<p>“I didn’t pay much attention at first. They
were talking about some fellow named Fellus
or something like that—”</p>

<p>“Phalos,” interrupted Don. “That’s another
Egyptian that’s on the ship. Kind of an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
old man, a pretty good kind of a scout, it
seems to me.”</p>

<p>“I guess that’s the one, then,” said Teddy.
“I hadn’t listened long before I knew that they
were trying to put something over on this Phalos,
as you call him. Then I lifted up the edge
of the tarpaulin a bit, and took a peep at them.
The moon was up, so I had a good look, and I
knew them again the minute I saw them at the
table.”</p>

<p>“What were they trying to put over on
him?”</p>

<p>“Seems he’s got some papers they want
to get. I couldn’t get just the rights of it,
but it seemed mighty important to them. Heard
one of them say it would make them rich if
they could cop them. And I don’t think they’d
stop at anything to get them. I heard one of
them say something that means about the same
thing as our ‘dead men tell no tales.’”</p>

<p>Just at this moment the two men they were
talking about passed them. They were not
sauntering, in the manner of most of the passengers,
but moved as though they were bent
on a purpose, like hounds on a trail.</p>

<p>“Look like a pair of pirates,” snorted
Teddy.</p>

<p>“They wouldn’t take any prizes at a beauty
show,” agreed Don. “Wonder what they’re
up to now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>“Something they wouldn’t want any one to
know about, I bet,” Teddy conjectured.</p>

<p>Suddenly a thought struck Don, and he
started up.</p>

<p>“I didn’t see Phalos at the table to-night!”
he exclaimed. “He sits near us, and is usually
there.”</p>

<p>“Well, what of it?” asked Teddy carelessly.
“Perhaps he’s off his feed. And that’s where
he’s different from me.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it was something like that,”
agreed Don, sinking back again into his chair.</p>

<p>They chatted of other things, but Don’s
mind was haunted by a feeling of uneasiness.
He could not shake off a conviction that something
was wrong with the benevolent old Egyptian,
whom he had learned to like. He told
himself that he was foolish. Still an uncomfortable
feeling persisted. At last he rose
with decision.</p>

<p>“Come along, Brick,” he said. “Let’s
stretch our legs a bit.”</p>

<p>“Don’t feel as though I could move,” complained
Teddy. “I was a trifle hearty at the
table to-night.”</p>

<p>“A trifle!” jeered Don. “That certainly is
putting it mildly! All the more reason why
you should walk it off. Up you come.”</p>

<p>As he reinforced his urging by a vigorous
tug at his friend’s sleeve, Brick yielded with
a groan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>“Where are you going?” he asked, extricating
himself with difficulty from the depths of
his chair.</p>

<p>“Oh, just going to take a turn or two about
the deck,” answered Don. “And if by chance
we should happen to run across those two
Egyptians, so much the better.”</p>

<p>“What have you got on your chest?” asked
Teddy, with quickened interest.</p>

<p>“Just a little hunch of mine that they may
be up to some mischief,” answered Don. “What
you’ve told me about them and Phalos has
made me feel uneasy, especially as the old
fellow didn’t turn up at meal time.”</p>

<p>Teddy’s previous experiences with Don in
the Sahara had given him considerable respect
for his friend’s “hunches,” and he went along
with alacrity.</p>

<p>Twice they made the circuit of the deck without
seeing the people of whom they were in
search. Then, in the growing dusk, Don caught
a glimpse of Tezra and Nepahak emerging hurriedly
from a cabin a little way ahead.</p>

<p>He clutched Teddy’s arm and drew him into
a corridor leading from the deck, where they
stood until the men had passed.</p>

<p>“Come along,” he said, relinquishing his
hold on his friend’s arm and hastening out on
deck.</p>

<p>“But I thought you were going to follow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
them!” exclaimed Teddy, as he saw that Don
was going in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>“Not now,” replied Don. “That was Phalos’
cabin they came from, and I’m going to
take a look at that first.”</p>

<p>In a moment the two boys were standing
before the cabin in question, and Don knocked
on the door.</p>

<p>There was no answer and no sound of any
one stirring inside. Don waited a moment and
then knocked again. Still no answer. Then
he tried the knob. The door refused to give.
It was locked.</p>

<p>Don looked hurriedly about and saw that
the door of the room immediately adjoining
was standing a little ajar. He pushed it open
and found that it contained no bed but a miscellaneous
collection of boxes, and was evidently
a storeroom.</p>

<p>His eyes roved over the place and detected
a transom at the side nearer the cabin of Phalos.
Instantly he beckoned to Teddy and they
went in, closing the door softly.</p>

<p>Making no noise, Don piled up some of the
boxes and stood on them. This brought his
head to a level with the transom.</p>

<p>For a moment he could make out nothing
definite in the cabin. Then, as his eyes grew
accustomed to the shadows, he saw the form
of Phalos sitting in a chair. Looking closer,
he saw that the old man was tightly bound and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
that a gag had been thrust into his mouth.</p>

<p>Teddy also had mounted the boxes and stood
at Don’s side.</p>

<p>“Do you see that?” asked Don, in a whisper.
“There isn’t a minute to lose.”</p>

<p>“What should we do?” exclaimed Teddy.</p>

<p>Don tried the transom and found that it
swung toward him. He pulled it still further
forward and fastened it to a hook above his
head.</p>

<p>The aperture was none too large, but sufficient
to permit the passage of his body.</p>

<p>“Come after me as soon as you can,” directed
Don, as he swung himself up and
through the opening.</p>

<p>He dropped lightly on the other side and
a moment later Teddy had followed him.</p>

<p>They rushed to the chair in which the old
Egyptian was fastened. His eyes, which had
been closed, opened with a look of terror, to be
quickly replaced by one of hope as he recognized
Don.</p>

<p>In a trice the boys had pulled out their jack-knives
and were sawing away at the cords that
bound the captive. In a few minutes they succeeded
in freeing him from bonds and gag.</p>

<p>The old Egyptian tried to speak, but his
tongue at first refused to obey him.</p>

<p>“How can I thank you?” he said, at last,
to the boys, who were rubbing his wrists and
hands to restore the circulation. “How can I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
reward you? You’ve saved my property, and
perhaps you’ve saved my life.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” replied Don. “We’re
glad we came in time.”</p>

<p>“But how did you know what had happened
to me?” asked Phalos.</p>

<p>“We saw those countrymen of yours coming
from the cabin,” explained Don. “We
knew that they were enemies of yours, and
as you hadn’t turned up at meal time, we
thought there was something wrong. What
have those men got against you that they
should treat you this way?”</p>

<p>“They are robbers,” replied Phalos. “They
knew that I had a great secret—” Here he
checked himself and darted a quick glance at
his deliverers. “That is, they know I have
some valuable property which they want to
take from me.”</p>

<p>“Where are they now?” asked Don.</p>

<p>“They’ve gone to their own cabin to get
implements to torture me with,” was the startling
reply. “I refused to tell them what they
wanted, and they said they would find a way
to cure my stubbornness. They may be back
at any minute. We must get out of here at
once.”</p>

<p>“Right you are!” exclaimed Don. “We’ll
report the matter to the captain and have the
rascals arrested. Come right along. You take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
one arm, Brick, and I’ll steady him on the
other side.”</p>

<p>They helped the old Egyptian to his feet.
Just then they heard the grating of a key in
the lock.</p>

<p>“It’s Tezra and Nepahak!” exclaimed the
Egyptian, in an agitated whisper. “They’re
coming back.”</p>

<p>Don’s eyes darted about the room and fell
on the curtains shielding the bed.</p>

<p>“Sit there,” he commanded, thrusting Phalos
back in his chair. “Come, Brick.”</p>

<p>In a flash the two boys were behind the curtains.</p>

<p>The stateroom door opened, and Tezra and
Nepahak entered, the latter carrying several
objects that by their faint clinking seemed to
be steel tools or implements of some kind.</p>

<p>Phalos had settled back in his chair, and in
the gathering darkness seemed to be in the
same condition as the rascals had left him.</p>

<p>Nepahak stepped over to the electric switch,
but his accomplice halted him sharply.</p>

<p>“Don’t turn on that light, you fool,” he
snarled. “This flashlight of mine will give us
all the light we need.”</p>

<p>He stepped over to the silent figure in the
chair.</p>

<p>“Now, Phalos, we’re going to make you
listen to reason,” he said in a tone of deadly determination.
“We haven’t followed you half-way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
around the world to be balked at last.
We know that you have the secret of the Tombs
of Gold, and we’re going to get it from you.
If you tell it to us, we will release you and
you won’t be hurt. If you refuse, we have
something here that will make you tell. And
if we have to torture you, you will wish you
had never been born. Now I’m going to take
that gag from your mouth, so that you can
tell me your decision.”</p>

<p>He turned to his companion.</p>

<p>“Come here, Nepahak,” he commanded.
“Stand on that side of him while I remove the
gag. Clap your hand over his mouth if he
should try to shout an alarm. But first hand
me the flashlight.”</p>

<p>He took the light his confederate handed to
him and flashed it on the face of his intended
victim.</p>

<p>A wild exclamation escaped from him as he
noticed the absence of the gag and saw also
that the cords had been cut.</p>

<p>“Who has been here?” he cried, in alarm.
“What does this mean? Come back here,
you,” he called to Nepahak, who was already
making toward the door, intent upon escape.</p>

<p>“Now!” whispered Don, touching Teddy’s
arm.</p>

<small><span class="smcap">The Fight in the Dark</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next instant the boys rushed from their
hiding place and launched themselves upon the
rascals.</p>

<p>They were both tall and muscular, and had
the advantage of the surprise. Don knocked
the flashlight from Tezra’s hand, and lashed
out at him with both fists. The blows staggered
the Egyptian, and his confusion was increased
by tripping over the leg of Phalos,
who was rising from his seat to take part in
the fracas.</p>

<p>Tezra went down full length on the floor,
with Don on top of him. Teddy had grappled
with Nepahak and dragged him from the door.</p>

<p>The sound of voices and of hurrying feet
outside indicated that the uproar had been
heard. The imminence of capture made the
rascals frantic, and with a desperate effort they
freed themselves from their opponents, tore
open the door, and vanished.</p>

<p>A moment later several of the crew with one
of the officers came into the room. One of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
the men turned on the electric light, and the
party looked with exclamations of astonishment
at the disordered room and the panting
and disheveled boys.</p>

<p>“What’s going on here?” asked the officer
sharply.</p>

<p>Phalos stepped forward.</p>

<p>“Two men tried to rob me,” he explained.
“They had bound and gagged me. These boys
learned of my plight and came to my help.”</p>

<p>“Who were the men that tried to rob you and
where are they?” asked the officer.</p>

<p>“They pulled away and ran out of the door
just before you got here,” was the reply.
“Their names are Tezra and Nepahak. You
will find their names on the passenger list of
the boat.”</p>

<p>The officer gave some hurried commands to
his men and they went out. Then he turned
to Phalos.</p>

<p>“Are you hurt?” he asked solicitously.</p>

<p>“Not seriously,” answered the old Egyptian.
“Somewhat bruised by the rough handling
they gave me and shaken up by the experience.
Nothing more than that.”</p>

<p>“I am glad to hear that,” was the reply.
“This has been a most deplorable occurrence.
I assure you that we will make every effort
to arrest the rascals and hand them over to the
authorities as soon as we reach port. In the
meantime, I would deem it a favor if you and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
these boys—who, by the way, showed mighty
good pluck in tackling the thieves—would
kindly keep this matter to yourselves. It
doesn’t do the ship or the line any good to have
a thing of this kind noised about. Then, too,
it’s apt to make the other passengers nervous
and spoil the pleasure of their journey. Would
you mind promising me that?”</p>

<p>“Not the least in the world,” answered Phalos
promptly, and Don and Teddy nodded in
agreement.</p>

<p>“With the exception of my uncles,” qualified
Don. “They’re my guardians and have
a right to know anything that happens to me
while I’m traveling in their charge. But I
can promise that they won’t mention it to any
one else.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” replied the officer. “Now,
Mr. Phalos, is there anything I can do for you?
Perhaps you would like to have me send the
ship’s doctor in to look you over.”</p>

<p>“Don’t take that trouble, thanks,” replied
Phalos. “I was not injured. A good night’s
sleep will probably set me up again.”</p>

<p>“Did the thieves get anything?” asked the
officer, casting a look around as he prepared to
leave.</p>

<p>“Nothing at all, thanks to the courage of
those two brave boys.”</p>

<p>“I’ll have a guard set over this room, so
that if those fellows should come back he can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
nab them,” promised the officer. “But I guess
they’ll steer clear of it. Probably we’ll have
them in custody before morning.”</p>

<p>He bade Phalos and the boys good-night and
went out, closing the door behind him.</p>

<p>“I guess we’d better be going too, Mr. Phalos,”
said Don. “That is, if there’s nothing
more we can do for you.”</p>

<p>“I think you’ve done quite enough for me
for one night,” replied Phalos, with a grateful
smile. “I can never thank you enough.
You may have saved my life. At any rate
you’ve preserved me from physical pain and
permitted me to retain in my own keeping
something that is very precious to me. I shall
see you again in the morning and will express
my thanks, I hope, a little more adequately.”</p>

<p>“We’re only too glad to have been of service,”
answered Don. “Good-night,” and with
a last word of thanks echoing in their ears, he
and Teddy went out on the deck.</p>

<p>“Gee!” said Teddy, as he drew a long
breath, “I feel like something that the cat
dragged in, and I guess I look it too.”</p>

<p>“Same here,” laughed Don, as he took in
the torn collars and rumpled clothes of himself
and his friend. “It was some little fight
those rascals put up. I only hope they’re nabbed
by this time. But say, Brick, how about
that little hunch of mine?” and he gave his comrade
a playful poke in the ribs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>“You win,” agreed Teddy. “Your hunches
are there with the goods, all right. But let’s
get to our cabin and wash up and slip into some
other clothes.”</p>

<p>As they were opening the door of their stateroom,
they met captain Sturdy and Professor
Bruce.</p>

<p>“Oh, there you are,” said the captain. “We
were wondering what had become of you. But
what has happened?” he asked quickly, as he
noticed the state of the boys’ garments.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ve had a little scrimmage,” replied
Don, and went on to narrate the exciting happenings
of the last half hour.</p>

<p>His uncle listened with interest, not unmixed
with some alarm, interrupting him at times with
questions.</p>

<p>“You did well, both of you,” Captain Sturdy
said approvingly when Don had finished.
“Though it would perhaps, have been more prudent
if you had summoned help as soon as you
had discovered the state of things before you
climbed through the transom. You ran a big
chance of having one or both of those rascals
stick a knife into you.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” answered Don. “But I
didn’t think of that. All I saw was that helpless
old man in the power of those villains.
If they’d only been a minute or two later in
getting back, we’d have had the old man out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
on the deck, and they wouldn’t have dared to
attack him there.”</p>

<p>“It’s curious that the thieves should have
attempted so bold a thing right here on the
ship,” remarked the professor. “They must
have been desperately anxious to get what he
had. Had they searched his baggage?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Don. “And that’s the funny
thing about it. They hadn’t broken into his
bags or trunk, and it didn’t seem that they
intended to do so.”</p>

<p>“But you say that they were there to rob
him?” said the professor, in some perplexity.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Don. “But the thing they
wanted to get wasn’t in his baggage. It was
in his mind.”</p>

<p>“You mean they wanted to extort a secret
from him?” put in the captain.</p>

<p>“That was it,” Don affirmed. “The old
Egyptian told us that himself. They were going
to torture him to get it out of him.”</p>

<p>“It must have been very valuable if they
were prepared to go to such lengths as that,”
remarked the professor. “Did he tell you
what it was?”</p>

<p>“He didn’t,” replied Don. “But Tezra let
it out when he told Mr. Phalos that he was going
to make him tell the secret of the Tombs
of Gold.”</p>

<p>“The Tombs of Gold!” exclaimed Professor
Bruce, with a start.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>“Ever hear of them, Amos?” asked his
brother-in-law, casting a keen glance at him.</p>

<p>“Many times,” replied the professor. “But
I never knew how much faith to put in their
existence. There have been persistent rumors
that there are such tombs in the Egyptian desert,
and more than one expedition has been
organized to search for them. But they’ve always
had their troubles for their pains.”</p>

<p>“Then you think they’re myths?” asked the
captain.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t say that,” was the reply.
“There are so many wonderful things in that
mysterious country that I’d hesitate to say
offhand that anything was impossible. And our
own experience in connection with the city of
Brass and Cave of Emeralds in the Sahara
have taught us how much truth there may often
be concealed in tradition.”</p>

<p>“True enough,” agreed the captain. “I’m
beginning to think we may find this old Egyptian
a very interesting person.”</p>

<p>“He promised to look us up to-morrow morning,”
said Don. “If he does, I’ll introduce
him to you.”</p>

<p>The boys were eager the next morning to
learn whether the rascals had been apprehended.
Don sought out the officer whom he
had seen the night before, a Mr. Maitland.</p>

<p>“Anything doing, Mr. Maitland?” he inquired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>“Not a thing,” was the disappointed reply.
“We haven’t found hide or hair of them. They
seem to have vanished into thin air. But I’m
having a quiet hunt going on for them, and
sooner or later we’ll get our hands on them.
They must be somewhere on the ship.”</p>

<p>“Unless they jumped overboard,” suggested
Don.</p>

<p>The officer laughed.</p>

<p>“Not a chance,” he replied. “Rascals like
that think too much of their precious skins.
We’ll catch them some time skulking around the
ship. For the present, they’ve probably slipped
down a hatchway into a hold. There are
plenty of hiding places there, and for a time
they may elude us. But not for long.”</p>

<p>Phalos had not appeared at the breakfast
table, but had been served in his room. About
the middle of the forenoon, however, he made
his appearance, and, catching sight of Don
and his party, came up to them with a smile.</p>

<p>“I was too agitated last night to thank you
properly,” he said, addressing himself to Don
and Teddy. “But I want to do it now. In
my confusion, I didn’t even learn your names.”</p>

<p>“This is my friend, Teddy Allison,” said
Don, indicating his comrade. “These are my
uncles, Professor Bruce and Captain Sturdy.
My own name is Don Sturdy.”</p>

<p>“Sturdy!” exclaimed the Egyptian, as he
acknowledged the introductions. “I had a very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
dear friend of that name once, a Mr. Richard
Sturdy. Is he, by any chance, related to you?”</p>

<p>“Related!” cried Don, as an electric shock
seemed to pass through him. “He’s my father!
Oh, tell me, what do you know about him?”</p>

<p>Phalos looked at him, a little surprised at
his vehemence.</p>

<p>“It’s some years since I saw or heard of
him,” he replied. “But why do you ask?
Surely you must know more about his whereabouts
than I do.”</p>

<p>Don’s new-found hope died almost as soon
as it was born, and his face was clouded with
disappointment.</p>

<p>“Mr. Richard Sturdy is my brother,” explained
the captain. “He went away some
time ago on an exploring expedition. The ship
he sailed on was wrecked, and my brother received
an injury to his head that we fear has
affected his mind. We are now going to Egypt
to look for him.”</p>

<p>Then, while the old Egyptian listened with
the keenest interest and sympathy, Don’s uncle
told briefly of the happenings that had brought
the party on the present voyage.</p>

<p>“I am very sorry to hear this,” Phalos observed,
when the story was finished. “I sincerely
hope your search will be crowned with
success. It may be that I can help you, for
I know my native country as no foreigner can.
And, if I can, you may command my services.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
I may be able to repay in some small measure
the debt I owe to this brave nephew of yours
and his friend.”</p>

<p>“We appreciate your offer, and we shall certainly
avail ourselves of it,” said the professor
warmly. “Perhaps you can help us even now
by telling us something about your acquaintance
with my brother-in-law.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Sturdy and I were drawn together by
many common interests while he was in my
country,” explained Zeta Phalos. “He was an
enthusiast about the monuments and wonders
of old Egypt, and that, of course, was pleasing
to me. He was especially interested in the tombs
of former Egyptian rulers, and spent weeks
and months in studying those that had been
opened and in looking for others that still remained
untouched. I was able to help him in
this, for all my life has been practically devoted
to the same thing. So we grew to be
very close friends.”</p>

<p>“Was there any particular tomb or tombs
that he was searching for?” asked Don eagerly.</p>

<p>The old Egyptian shot a quick look at his
questioner.</p>

<p>“Perhaps he was,” he answered evasively.
“But he was rather a reticent man and kept
his plans pretty closely to himself.”</p>

<p>“We thought perhaps he was looking for
the Tombs of Gold,” remarked the professor
casually, polishing his glasses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>Phalos gave a perceptible start.</p>

<p>“You’ve heard of the Tombs of Gold?” he
asked, in a tone that he evidently tried to make
careless.</p>

<p>“Oh, I know there’s a tradition that such
tombs exist somewhere in Egypt,” replied Professor
Bruce. “I don’t know whether there’s
any truth in it or not.”</p>

<p>“Egypt is rich in treasure,” observed Phalos
noncommittally. “In ancient days it
stretched from the Euphrates to the headwaters
of the Nile. Gold was brought in tribute to
her kings from all parts of Africa and Asia.
In the time of the Pharaohs her wealth was
almost incalculable. Centuries have elapsed
since then, but who shall say that some of that
wealth does not remain either above or below
her soil?”</p>

<p>“Then you believe that the Tombs of Gold
really exist?” asked Don, his eyes shining.</p>

<p>“I did not say so,” replied Phalos. “It is
possible that Mr. Sturdy thought so. He was
certainly intent upon some definite object he
had in mind. He was not going about at random.
Especially was he interested in the Valley
of the Kings. There he spent most of his
time, working sometimes till far into the
night.”</p>

<p>“It is reasonable to conclude, then, that he
has now gone to the Valley of the Kings, do
you think?” asked the captain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>“That is certainly where I would look for
him first,” replied Phalos. “You will have
to pass through Cairo to get there. My home
is in that city, and I hope you will make it your
headquarters during your stay.”</p>

<p>The friendship between Zeta Phalos and the
members of the Sturdy party grew deeper as
the voyage progressed. It soon became evident
that the old Egyptian would prove invaluable
to them when once they had landed and started
on their search.</p>

<p>One night as the vessel was nearing the Mediterranean,
Don found it impossible to sleep.
His mind was full of thoughts of his parents,
joyous when he thought of the coming reunion
with his dear mother, sad when he dwelt on
the plight of his equally dear father.</p>

<p>What had become of the latter? Was he
wandering about aimlessly in the foreign land,
exposed perhaps to hunger and thirst, to poverty
and hardship? Perhaps at that moment
he was dead! At the thought Don’s heart was
wrung with anguish. Or perhaps—and the
thought was equally terrible—his mind, that
splendid scientific mind, was gone forever.</p>

<p>Tortured by these possibilities, Don at last
rose, slipped on some clothes, and went out on
the deck.</p>

<p>It was about two o’clock in the morning, and
there was no one in sight except occasional
members of the crew intent on some duty and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
shadowy figures of officers making their round
of the ship.</p>

<p>The vessel was passing through the Straits
of Gibraltar, and Don sat down in a chair near
the stern, trying to divert his somber thoughts
by gazing at the formidable frowning Rock that
stood as the symbol of Great Britain’s power
in the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>A slight splash in the water attracted his
attention. He turned his eyes in the direction
of the sound, but could see nothing.</p>

<p>Then came a second splash, and with his
eyes somewhat adjusted to the darkness, he
could faintly detect a human head above the
surface of the water. Almost instantly the
head was lost in the gloom, but a faint trail
of foam traced the course of a man swimming
toward the shore.</p>

<p>At first Don jumped to the conclusion that
a man had fallen overboard. But with the
second splash he came to the conclusion that
two were hardly likely to have fallen over so
nearly at the same time. Besides, there was no
call for help. And instead of swimming toward
the ship, one, at least, was certainly making
for the shore, which at that place was not
more than a quarter of a mile distant, and
probably the other man was following his example.</p>

<p>Just as Don was wondering what he ought
to do, Mr. Maitland, who happened to be on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
watch, came along. He peered at Don and
recognized him.</p>

<p>“Keeping pretty late hours, aren’t you?” he
asked, with a smile. “What’s the matter?
Too hot to sleep?”</p>

<p>“Not that exactly,” replied Don. “I was
restless, and thought that a change might make
me drowsy enough to make it worth while to go
back to bed. I’m glad you came along, Mr.
Maitland. Did you hear those splashes in the
water?”</p>

<p>“Splashes!” exclaimed the officer, alert on
the instant. “No. Where were they?”</p>

<p>“Rather close to the stern,” replied Don.
“One followed close upon another. I know
that one was made by a man, for I saw him,
and I suppose the other one was too.”</p>

<p>The officer unslung his night glasses and
looked in the direction of the shore, but could
make out nothing.</p>

<p>“What do you suppose they were?” inquired
Don. “Could they have been deserters,
do you think?”</p>

<p>“That’s possible, I suppose,” replied Mr.
Maitland, with a perplexed air, as he put up
his glasses. “Though I don’t know of any
dissatisfaction among the crew. And, anyway,
sailors usually wait until they reach some port
before they take French leave. By Jove! I
have it,” he cried. “It’s those scoundrels that
tried to rob the Egyptian.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>Don jumped to his feet.</p>

<p>“Do you think so?” he cried.</p>

<p>“That’s it, for a thousand dollars!” declared
the officer emphatically. “They’ve managed
somehow to find a hiding place in a hold, though
I don’t see for the life of me how they did it.
They probably knew that we’d pass close to
the shore when we got to the Straits, and they
decided to make a swim for it.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you get out a boat and capture
them?” asked Don, chagrined at the thought of
the rascals’ escape.</p>

<p>Mr. Maitland shook his head.</p>

<p>“No use,” he replied. “By the time we
rounded to and lowered a boat they’d have
reached the shore. Probably they’re there
now. Oh, they’ve put one over on us, all right.
It’s a rotten shame, too, for they richly deserved
to be put behind the bars.”</p>

<p>There was no use, however, of crying over
spilt milk, and after a few minutes more of
conversation Don went again to his room.</p>

<p>His story of the night’s events to the members
of his party and the old Egyptian the
next morning created a stir. Phalos especially
looked grave.</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Don, to cheer him up,
“we’re not dead sure it was those fellows at
all. Though Mr. Maitland told me this morning
that the crew had been checked up and none
was missing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>“I’m afraid it’s only too true that Tezra and
Nepahak have made their escape,” mourned
Phalos. “And if they have, I shall hear from
them again.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they’ve had such a scare thrown
into them that they’ll let you alone for the
future,” ventured Teddy.</p>

<p>Phalos shook his head.</p>

<p>“I know them too well,” he asserted.
“Tezra is persistent and relentless. Nepahak
is only his tool. They may bide their time, but
soon or late they will renew their attempt to
get possession of—”</p>

<p>“Of what?” asked the captain, as Phalos
hesitated.</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” returned Phalos, evading a
reply. “I am not going to worry about what
may happen. Let us talk of something pleasanter,”
and he launched into a description of
the Temple of Philae that he had been discussing
with the professor the night before.</p>

<p>They were now in the sparkling waters of
the Mediterranean, almost every foot of whose
coast and islands was rich in historic associations
of the “glory that was Greece and the
grandeur that was Rome.”</p>

<p>Under other circumstances, Don would have
found an endless fascination in this storied sea
and its surroundings, but now his mind was so
taken up with thoughts of his parents that he
could pay little attention to anything else. All<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
that he wanted was Egypt, the Egypt where he
would find his mother, the Egypt where
he hoped to find his father. This filled his whole
horizon. Nothing else mattered. When, oh,
when would Egypt loom up on the horizon?</p>

<p>And his heart gave such a leap that it almost
seemed as though it would leave his body
when one morning a faint blur in the distance,
rapidly growing larger, revealed itself as the
port of Alexandria, where he would first step
on Egyptian soil.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

<small><span class="smcap">On the Trail</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Only</span> hours now separated Don from his
mother, provided that she was still in Alexandria.
But he had been thwarted so many
times in the search for his dear ones, the cup
of happy expectation had been so often dashed
to the ground just as he was lifting it to his
lips, that he scarcely dared to hope that this
time his longing would be realized.</p>

<p>What might have happened since he had embarked
at New York? Perhaps she was ill.
Possibly she had been called away from the
city by some clew as to the whereabouts of her
husband. As to the possibility that he might
find both of his parents reunited—Don scarcely
dared hope for that.</p>

<p>He packed up all his belongings so that
everything would be in readiness, and then
paced the deck in a fever of impatience.</p>

<p>The steamer seemed to be only creeping
along. Yet it was plowing through the water
at a rapid speed that only slowed down when
they neared the older of the two harbors of the
famous Mediterranean city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>Captain Sturdy and Professor Bruce were
almost as agitated as Don himself, though they
managed to maintain more of a curb on their
emotions. Teddy, too, was wrought up because
of his keen sympathy with his friend.</p>

<p>Phalos bade them all a cordial good-bye just
before they landed.</p>

<p>“Though it is really <i>au revoir</i> instead of
good-bye,” he said, with a genial smile, “for I
am going to hold you strictly to your promise
to come to see me in Cairo as soon as you reach
there, and, if possible, make my house your
headquarters. I shall never forget,” he added,
turning to Don and Teddy, “what you did for
me in saving my—property and quite probably
my life. You may count upon me for all I can
do in helping you to find Mr. Sturdy.”</p>

<p>They thanked him, and promised that they
would surely see him in Cairo.</p>

<p>They landed amid clamor and hubbub, the
cries of porters and pleadings of beggars that
are inseparable from all the seaports of the
East. To these they paid no attention, but
hailed a taxicab and drove through the large
handsome streets of the European quarter to
the hotel from which Mrs. Sturdy had dispatched
her cablegram.</p>

<p>“Is a Mrs. Richard Sturdy among your
guests?” asked the captain, as the party went
up to the desk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>Don’s heart was in his throat as he listened
for the answer.</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the reply. “Do you wish to see
her?” and he reached for the desk telephone.</p>

<p>“No need of announcing us,” broke in Don.
“These gentlemen are her brothers and I am
her son. We will go right up, if you please.”</p>

<p>The clerk summoned a bellboy, who rose
languidly and came toward them.</p>

<p>“Hurry, hurry!” urged Don, slipping a coin
into his hand. “See how quickly you can lead
us there.”</p>

<p>There was a noticeable quickening of step on
the part of the attendant as he moved toward
the elevator.</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll stay down here till you send
for me,” said Teddy hesitatingly.</p>

<p>“No, you won’t!” exclaimed Don, reaching
out and pulling him in with him.</p>

<p>They ascended to the second floor, and hurried
down the hall to a door at which their
guide pointed.</p>

<p>Don was in the van, and with a trembling
hand knocked on the door. It opened almost
instantly, and a sweet-faced, slender woman,
still young, though there were lines of care on
her forehead, stood before them.</p>

<p>“Mother! Mother!” cried Don, and threw
himself in her arms.</p>

<p>“Don! My precious boy! Oh, my dear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
boy!” cried Mrs. Sturdy, sobbing with happiness
as she folded Don close to her heart.</p>

<p>She hugged and kissed him and patted his
hair, standing him off at times to look into his
face and then drawing him again to her as
though she would never let him go.</p>

<p>Don’s arms were about her. Tears of joy
ran down his cheeks as he tried incoherently
to tell how much he loved her and had missed
her and how delighted he was that at last he
had found her.</p>

<p>Now it was the turn of the captain and the
professor, who had stood aside for a moment
while mother and son were tasting the first
bliss of reunion. Their eyes too were moist, as
they embraced the sister and sister-in-law who
was unspeakably dear to them and for whom
they had searched over so large a part of the
world.</p>

<p>It was a long time before the members of
the happy excited group had gained some measure
of control over themselves. Then Don
seated his mother in a chair, on the arm of
which he sat, holding her hand as though he
felt he must keep close grip on her, lest she
should vanish and he awake to find it all a
dream.</p>

<p>The others drew up their chairs, and it was
then for the first time that Don noticed
that Teddy was not with them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>“Where’s Teddy?” he asked, as he looked
around the room.</p>

<p>“Outside in the hall, I imagine,” replied the
professor. “He probably feels shy about coming
into what is so strictly a family party.”</p>

<p>“Who’s Teddy?” asked Mrs. Sturdy, with
a smile.</p>

<p>“A friend of mine who came along with us,”
explained Don. “We met him when we were
in the Sahara, and it was his father who first
gave us news of the sinking of the <i>Mercury</i>.
He hasn’t any mother. He’s a splendid fellow,
Mother. You’ll love him.”</p>

<p>“Of course, I shall, if he’s a friend of
yours,” said Mrs. Sturdy. “And I’ll be a
mother to him, as far as I can, if he will let
me.”</p>

<p>“May I bring him in?” asked Don eagerly.</p>

<p>“Surely.”</p>

<p>Don dashed out of the door, found Teddy
leaning against the wall of the corridor,
grabbed him and dragged him in.</p>

<p>“Here he is, Mother,” he sang out, releasing
his captive. “This is Teddy Allison, the best
pal a fellow ever had.”</p>

<p>Whatever shyness Teddy might have felt
was banished at once by the warmth with which
Mrs. Sturdy drew him to her and gave him a
hug, putting him at ease at once.</p>

<p>There was a host of questions from Mrs.
Sturdy regarding Ruth, who, the captain in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
cablegram had assured her, was safe with them
at home. When these queries had been satisfactorily
answered, she in turn told them of the
adventures of herself and her husband after
they had been rescued from the <i>Mercury</i>.</p>

<p>Tears came into her eyes as, in response to
their first eager queries, she told them that
nothing had developed as to her husband’s
whereabouts since she had sent her cablegram.</p>

<p>“I’ve searched everywhere,” she said.
“I’ve written and telegraphed to all parts of
Egypt. At first I was crippled for lack of
funds, but after I received the money you sent
I employed private detective agencies as well.
But all of it has resulted in nothing. It is as
though he has vanished off the face of the
earth.”</p>

<p>At this point she broke down.</p>

<p>“Oh, if you knew how I have suffered!” she
said. “If you only knew!”</p>

<p>Don hugged her and tried to comfort her,
and the professor patted her hand consolingly.</p>

<p>“Never mind, Alice,” he said. “We’re with
you now, and we’ll search the whole length and
breadth of Egypt.”</p>

<p>“We’ll find him,” asserted the captain, the
very bigness of him adding power to the conviction
in his tone. “You’ve had an awful burden
to bear, you poor girl, but now, as far as
you can, you must shift it to our shoulders.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>She looked at them gratefully through her
tears.</p>

<p>“It would not be so bad,” she resumed, “if
he went by his right name or if he even knew
his name. Then it might be easy to trace him.
But all we have to go by is a description of
him, and that might so easily apply to many
others that you can’t place much reliance on
it.</p>

<p>“It’s all been like a hideous nightmare since
the <i>Mercury</i> went down,” she resumed. “Richard’s
head was hurt by a block that struck him
in the confusion of getting off into the boat.
The wound healed, however, and for the first
few days he seemed to be all right. It was only
after we had been landed at Bahia in Brazil
and had started on our trip overland to Martin
Clifton’s house, from which we expected to
sail for the United States in the private yacht
he offered to place at our disposal, that I began
to notice something queer about him. His mind
seemed to be dwelling more and more on
Egypt. You know he spent a good deal of time
exploring there before the war.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” said the professor, and the
captain nodded in assent.</p>

<p>“He kept talking about the Valley of the
Kings in Egypt,” went on Mrs. Sturdy. “At
first I’d try to change the subject and get him to
talk of other things. But he always came back
to the one thing that engrossed his mind. Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
he would talk half to himself about figures and
measurements. He had a tape measure and
would go about the rooms in Mr. Clifton’s
house and get their length and breadth and
height. Then he would put them down on a
piece of paper and after studying them would
mutter. ‘That isn’t it. Must try further.’”</p>

<p>“Just the very thing you found scribbled on
those bits of paper among his memoranda,
Uncle Amos!” ejaculated Don. “He was looking
for some special thing, something of which
he already had the measurements.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure it was a tomb of some kind he had
in mind,” said Don’s mother. “Again and
again he would break out with something about
the Tombs of Gold—”</p>

<p>“The Tombs of Gold!” exclaimed Don, with
a start. “Why, that is what those fellows were
trying to get information about from that old
Egyptian!”</p>

<p>“The old Egyptian?” repeated Mrs. Sturdy
inquiringly.</p>

<p>“A man we met on the boat coming here,”
explained Don. “A man named Phalos. I’ll
tell you all about him later. But go on,
mother.”</p>

<p>“All I could think of was of getting back
home as soon as possible, so that Richard could
get the medical care that he needed,” his
mother continued. “But we were delayed in
starting, and all the time he kept getting worse.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
Oh, it was terrible to see such a splendid intellect
losing itself in delusion,” she sobbed.
“Again and again I felt that I would go crazy
myself.”</p>

<p>“Poor, dear mother!” said Don, putting his
arms around her neck.</p>

<p>“One night,” resumed Mrs. Sturdy, when
she could speak coherently, “there was a terrific
storm. The thunder and lightning seemed
to affect him strongly and bring things to a
climax. He and Ruth and I were seated in our
room when he suddenly started up, shouting, ‘I
must go to Egypt,’ and rushed out into the
darkness. I rushed out after him calling to
him to stop and come back. The thunder may
have drowned my voice, but at any rate he
didn’t heed me and kept on.”</p>

<p>Tears came into Don’s eyes as he pictured
his gently nurtured mother running in a frenzy
of anxiety and grief after his distraught father
in the rain and darkness.</p>

<p>“No one was abroad in that terrible storm,”
went on Mrs. Sturdy. “There was nobody I
could get to help me. Richard kept on till he
got to the river side. There was a vessel
moored to the wharf and he jumped on board.
I saw him stumble and disappear. I leaped
after him and stumbled into an open hatchway.
That was all I knew for a long time afterward.”</p>

<p>Don hugged her convulsively, too overcome<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
to trust himself to speak, while the professor
and the captain were not ashamed of the tears
that came into their eyes.</p>

<p>“When I came to myself,” resumed Don’s
mother, “I was in total darkness. My head
was dizzy, and it was some time before I realized
what had happened. Then it all came
back to me. I could tell from the pitching and
the swaying that the vessel was in motion. I
felt about me and found your father near by.
He was unconscious. After a while he came to
himself in part, though he was still dazed.</p>

<p>“Then I found a pole and hammered at the
hatch until they heard me and the cover was
taken off. They brought us up on deck. I found
that we were on a vessel bound for the Mediterranean.
There was no wireless on board, so
that I could not communicate with any one on
shore. But the captain and everybody on
board were very kind to us when I had told my
story. There was enough money in Richard’s
pockets to pay for our passage and leave a
modest amount when we should reach shore.
It was a long voyage and a most trying one.
The worst of it was that Richard no longer
recognized me. He declared that he had never
seen me before. He had the delusion that he
was King Ingot of the Bars of Gold.”</p>

<p>“Poor father! Poor mother!” murmured
Don, his heart wrung by the narration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>“But why didn’t you cable us the instant
you got to shore?” asked the captain.</p>

<p>“I should have done so, of course,” was the
reply. “But I kept hoping that Richard would
recover, and for his sake I wanted to keep the
matter secret from everybody who knew him,
even from you. I knew it would be a mortifying
memory for him all through his life to have
it known that he had been insane. Any man
would feel that way, and Richard is very sensitive.
If he had recovered, I would never have
divulged the secret, and I would have put Ruth,
too, under a pledge of silence.”</p>

<p>“I understand, and it does you credit,” said
the captain.</p>

<p>“Finally,” went on Mrs. Sturdy, “we
reached this city, and I got Richard on shore
and under the care of a physician. But nothing
could be done, the doctor said, except to
keep him as quiet and composed as possible
and depend upon the healing hand of Time to
set his poor mind aright. Physically, he was in
good condition, for the sea voyage had been
beneficial.</p>

<p>“But instead of getting better mentally, he
steadily grew more irrational. The very fact
that he was now in Egypt, the atmosphere, the
language, the heat, the sights, the sounds, emphasized
his delusion. Night and day he kept
dwelling on the Valley of the Kings. He would
declare that he was the king of the Valley of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
the Kings, and that he must go and look after
his kingdom. And one day he eluded me and
disappeared. No one had seen him go. No one
knew where he had gone. It was then that I
cabled to you. And now you are here, and, oh,
how thankful I am!”</p>

<p>Once more she broke into a storm of weeping,
for the strain of the narration and the picture
it had brought up before her were too
much for her overtaxed strength.</p>

<p>The others soothed and comforted her to the
extent of their power.</p>

<p>“You’ve been just wonderful,” declared
Don, as he hugged her to him.</p>

<p>“A perfect heroine,” asserted her brother.
“Not one woman in a thousand could have
stood up under such a strain.”</p>

<p>“I’m mighty proud of you, Alice,” said the
captain, his voice husky with emotion. “But
now all the work and responsibility are going
to be taken off your overburdened shoulders.
It’s up to us now. You must just rest and relax,
or you, too, will break down completely.
And, please God, we’ll bring Richard back to
you, and with care and the greatest skill that
we can command, it won’t be long before he’s
his old splendid self again. Then this terrible
thing will be nothing more to you than a dreadful
dream.”</p>

<p>Under their thoughtful ministrations and the
delight and reassurance that their presence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
gave her, Mrs. Sturdy gradually recovered her
composure. They refused to let her talk any
longer just then about her husband’s disappearance,
and chatted with her about Hillville
and Ruth and the other members of the household,
Don bringing a smile from her at Jennie’s
remark about her mistress being all alone
in “the land of the Pigamids and the Spinach.”</p>

<p>After a while the captain and the professor,
taking Teddy along with them, went out to attend
to the pressing matters in hand. Don
stayed with his mother to tell her of his adventures
in the Sahara and Brazil and the
thousand other things that she was eager to
know about.</p>

<p>The experience that Don’s uncles had acquired
in their travels about the world stood
them in good stead in the present situation.
Professor Bruce knew the language almost as
well as he did his own, and both were tactful
and at the same time masterful in dealing with
the native races of the East.</p>

<p>Before night fell they had learned by inquiries
in the native quarters that a man corresponding
to Richard Sturdy’s description
had secured a small party to go with him on
an exploring expedition. There had been no
explicit mention of the Valley of the Kings, but
the party had started south in that direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>Had they noticed anything peculiar about
the man? the professor asked.</p>

<p>“Well, Allah seems to have set a mark on
him,” his informant replied. “His eyes were
bright and he said that he was a king. But,
after all, many kings visit Egypt. And then,
all foreigners are queer. He promised to pay
his men well and to double or treble their pay
if he was successful in finding what he was
going for. So there were plenty that were willing
to go.”</p>

<p>This was much, but it was not enough, and
the two American men, still accompanied by
Teddy, prosecuted their researches untiringly
until they found the wife of one of the party
who had accompanied the bright-eyed man, and
she had heard her husband say that he was
going to the Valley of the Kings.</p>

<p>“So far, so good!” exclaimed Captain
Sturdy, as, tired but exultant, they made their
way to the European quarter.</p>

<p>“We at least have a goal to aim for,” declared
the professor.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

<small><span class="smcap">A Land of Wonders</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">And</span> now, Teddy,” said the captain, “we’ll
send a cablegram to that father of yours and
tell him all about his prodigal son and ask him
whether you can go with us or whether we’ll
have to bundle you back home.”</p>

<p>“Oh, please ask him to let me stay with you,
now that I’m here,” begged Teddy.</p>

<p>He noted with pleasure that the captain no
longer addressed him as “young man.” As a
matter of fact, the captain, who was extremely
fond of the boy, had long ago forgiven him,
and the way Teddy had borne himself in the
encounter with the rascals aboard the steamer
had fully reinstated him in the good graces of
his temporary guardian.</p>

<p>The cablegram was dispatched, and then,
after some inquiries at a shipping office, the
party made their way back to the hotel.</p>

<p>Don and his mother were delighted at the
news they had secured.</p>

<p>“I might have known that things would be
all right as soon as you got here,” said Mrs.
Sturdy gratefully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>“Oh, we old hounds are still some good when
it comes to picking up a trail,” replied her husband’s
brother, with a grin.</p>

<p>“And now we must get busy and start at
once,” said the professor. “Every hour is
precious.”</p>

<p>“I can start at almost a minute’s notice,” declared
Mrs. Sturdy.</p>

<p>The captain hesitated.</p>

<p>“I know just how you feel, Alice,” he said
slowly. “But, really, I think it would be better
for you not to go with us. The desert is no
place for a woman, and it’s going to be a very
hard and trying expedition.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I want to go!” exclaimed Mrs.
Sturdy, disappointment coming into her face.</p>

<p>“Of course, you naturally would,” rejoined
her brother-in-law. “But all the same I don’t
think it would be wise. You agree with me,
don’t you, Amos?” he asked, turning to Mrs.
Sturdy’s brother.</p>

<p>“I certainly do,” rejoined the latter. “You
see, Alice, with all you’ve gone through, you’ve
nearly reached the breaking point. Even if
you were perfectly well and strong, it would be
inadvisable; and as things stand, it would be
almost suicidal. We’ve made inquiries at the
shipping office, and a liner is sailing to-morrow.
You need to recuperate in the rest and
quiet of home. And then, too, Ruth needs you.”</p>

<p>The last proved the strongest argument in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
breaking down Mrs. Sturdy’s reluctance, and
she finally consented.</p>

<p>The few hours she still had left with Don
were golden ones for both mother and son, and
they spent every moment they could together
before the vessel sailed.</p>

<p>Her family saw her provided with every possible
comfort on the vessel that was to bear her
to the waiting arms of Ruth, and after loving
leave-takings, stood on the shore and waved to
her until her dear form at the steamer’s rail
could no longer be distinguished.</p>

<p>Don’s eyes were wet as he turned to go back
to the hotel after the parting from his mother,
but there was a measure of peace and happiness
in his heart to which it had been a
stranger for years. At least, he had found his
mother and held her in his embrace.</p>

<p>God had been good and restored to him his
mother and sister. Surely he could depend on
Him to help him find his father. The boy took
new courage and mentally girded up his loins
for the coming struggle.</p>

<p>Those left behind stopped at the telegraph
office on their way back to the hotel and found a
cablegram awaiting them from Mr. Allison.
Captain Sturdy tore it open while Don and
Teddy waited with bated breath.</p>

<p>The captain read the message aloud:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>“Young rascal ought to be spanked. Give
him my love. Would have let him go if I had
known. He can make the trip with you.
Thanks for your kindness. Know he is in good
hands. Will make matters right with you when
you get back.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Allison.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>Don clasped Teddy in his arms after the
reading of the telegram, and the two boys executed
a wild dance on the floor of the office,
much to the scandal of the native clerks, who
looked on open-eyed.</p>

<p>“Glory hallelujah!” cried Don. “You’re going
with us, Brick! Old scout, you’re going
with us! Do you hear?”</p>

<p>“It’s the reward of virtue,” said Brick, with
a shameless grin.</p>

<p>“Virtue!” snorted the captain, trying to
look stern, but not succeeding very well. “It
simply shows that a young scapegrace can
sometimes get by. Come along now. There’s
much to do, and we have to hustle.”</p>

<p>They “hustled” to such good purpose that
they were able to take the train for Cairo that
afternoon. They were agreeably surprised, or
at least the boys were, to find that they were
in a smart clean train that would compare
favorably with anything in Europe, and that
the express would cover the hundred and fifty
mile trip to Cairo in less than four hours. The
lads had expected the ramshackle affair, common<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
in the East, that would simply drag along
under all condition of discomfort.</p>

<p>“It’s due to the English occupation,” explained
the professor. “They see that everything
is good and up-to-date and in accord with
Western standards.”</p>

<p>Through the windows of the train, as it sped
along, the boys saw a fascinating panorama
unfolded. They were in a land that was literally
flowing with milk and honey. As far as
the eye could see, the soil was unbelievably
rich. There were great groves of palm trees,
their feathery fronds waving gracefully in the
air; fields of dark loam that needed only to be
tickled with the hoe to make them laugh; extensive
fields of cotton, looking like heaps of
drifted snow; and plantations of sugar cane,
the stalks crowded so thickly together as to
form what seemed almost an impenetrable forest.</p>

<p>The coloring of the landscape was also a
dream of beauty. The bright green of the
fields, the reddish brown of the Nile, along
whose banks they often wound, the mellow tints
of yellow rocks under a sky of cerulean blue,
formed a picture to delight the eye of an artist.</p>

<p>“A wonderful country,” remarked the professor.
“Rich beyond imagination, even after
centuries of Turkish misrule. We can imagine
what it must have been in the days of the
Pharaohs, when every inch of ground was carefully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
cultivated and when this valley of the Nile
supported an immense population.”</p>

<p>“What makes it so rich?” asked Teddy.</p>

<p>“The River Nile,” was the answer. “The
annual overflow of the river leaves a rich deposit
of mud that has gradually grown deeper
with the passage of centuries. Dry up the Nile,
and Egypt would no longer exist. It would be
just like the Sahara. The old Egyptians used
to worship the Nile as a god and pay sacrifices
to it, because they knew their very lives depended
upon it. The priests had pillars, on
which they marked each year the rising of the
waters. If the waters were high there would
be an abundant harvest. If they were low the
crops would be very poor. If unusually low,
the country would be threatened with famine.
In a very real sense the Nile is Egypt. Even
now, beyond the limits of the spread of the
water the country is practically a desert.”</p>

<p>The old and the new were in perpetual contact
all through the train journey. The railroad
stations were neat and well-kept, with
well-uniformed attendants and English clerks
in spotless white. Around them clustered
scores of beggars extending their skinny hands
toward the car windows and clamoring for
baksheesh. The train passed handsome villas
surrounded by beautiful gardens. These were
within a stone’s throw of squalid mud huts,
with ragged dirty children playing about the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
doors. Donkeys, so heavily laden with sugar
cane that the very heads of the patient animals
were hidden, were prodded along with sticks in
the hands of their drivers. These ancient burden-bearers
disputed the road with modern
motor cars, whose honking horns seemed
strangely out of place in that Oriental setting.</p>

<p>It was a fascinating study of contrasts, and
it so engrossed the attention of the boys that
it was with a sensation of regret they found
that they were approaching Cairo, the capital
of the kingdom and the greatest city of Africa.</p>

<p>They had telegraphed to Zeta Phalos that
they were coming, and they found him waiting
for them with a handsome touring car and a
uniformed chauffeur. He waved aside all their
suggestions that they might be taxing his hospitality
too much, and insisted on conveying
them to his home, to be his guests until they set
out on their search.</p>

<p>There was no denying such friendliness, and
they stepped into the car and were rapidly
whirled to the home of Phalos, which proved
to be a palatial one in the suburbs of the city,
not far from the banks of the Nile.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful structure, built in harmony
with the climate and surroundings.
There were many rooms opening on balconies
that overlooked a courtyard in which were
plashing fountains, and everything indicated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
that their host was a man of wealth, as well
as of breeding and culture.</p>

<p>After a dinner so good that Don and Teddy
ate till for very shame’s sake they had to stop,
the party adjourned to a balcony which fronted
on the river.</p>

<p>“Gee! pinch me somebody,” exclaimed
Teddy, as he sank into a chair and took in the
full glory of the sunset. “I feel as if I were
living in the days of the Arabian Nights.”</p>

<p>Don promptly obliged him with a vigorous
pinch.</p>

<p>“Ouch!” cried Teddy, rubbing the stinging
flesh. “You needn’t be so mighty literal.”</p>

<p>“A friend will always do what another
friend asks him to,” replied Don virtuously.</p>

<p>From the Nile came the sound of native
music, as a felucca glided down the stream with
a wide ripple spreading from her bows, the
oars of her crew swaying to the faint sounds
of a chantey, such perhaps as may have been
sung in the days of the Pharaohs. The white
sails of a dahabiyeh gleamed with a rosy tint
in the last rays of the sinking sun. It was a
scene of measureless peace and enchantment,
as far apart from the hubbub and bustle of
the modern world as though it were on another
planet.</p>

<p>The Americans roused themselves at last
from the trance into which they had fallen.
Phalos was speaking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>“I cannot tell you how glad I am to have
you with me,” he was assuring Don’s uncles.
“The more glad because it is in some sort a
compensation for some bad news that I received
from Alexandria just a few minutes before
you came.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to hear that,” said Professor
Bruce, straightening up in his chair. “May I
ask what it is? That is, if it’s nothing personal
and private.”</p>

<p>“In a sense I suppose it concerns all of us,”
Phalos answered slowly, toying with his
glasses. “Tezra and Nepahak have landed in
Alexandria!”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small><span class="smcap">Startling News</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Tezra</span> and Nepahak!” exclaimed Don, the
faces of the sinister pair coming up before his
memory.</p>

<p>“Those precious rascals!” ejaculated Captain
Sturdy, a frown passing over his brow.</p>

<p>“How do you know that they have landed?”
asked the professor, settling back uneasily into
his seat.</p>

<p>“From a sure source,” replied Phalos. “A
friend of mine in Alexandria, whom I took into
my confidence regarding my experience on
shipboard and who agreed to have a watch
kept on debarking passengers, brought me
word. He knows the men, and assures me
there is no mistake.”</p>

<p>“I had thought that by this time they were
below with Davy Jones,” grumbled Teddy.</p>

<p>“No such luck,” remarked Phalos, with a
smile that did not conceal the deep anxiety he
felt. “They must have made land all right
the night they slipped overboard.”</p>

<p>“But how could they have got here so
soon?” asked Don, in some perplexity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>“Had the luck to get an English liner that
stopped at Gibraltar the day after they had
swum to shore,” was the reply. “My friend
tells me that it is one of the fastest boats on
the line.”</p>

<p>“They say that the Evil One looks after his
own,” growled the captain.</p>

<p>“And this is one of the things that seems to
prove it,” added Don.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the professor, crossing his
legs, “now that they are here, what do you apprehend?”</p>

<p>“That they’ll be up to mischief right away,”
replied Phalos. “The experience they’ve been
through won’t change the intentions of such
calloused scoundrels. They’ll simply attribute
that to bad luck and try again.”</p>

<p>“It’s too bad that they have such a grudge
against you,” remarked Don.</p>

<p>“It isn’t a grudge,” explained the old Egyptian.
“I’ve never done them any harm,
and their feeling toward me isn’t prompted by
revenge. They simply know that I have a valuable
secret, and they are trying to extort it
from me.”</p>

<p>There was a dead silence in the group that
was in itself a question that all were too polite
to ask.</p>

<p>Phalos pondered long before he spoke.</p>

<p>“I have never revealed the secret to a living
soul,” he said at last. “But there is something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
about you that invites my confidence and assures
me that it will not be betrayed. Besides
I owe you something on the score of gratitude.”</p>

<p>They waved that aside with a gesture of
their hands.</p>

<p>“It concerns the tombs of a certain royal
family of an old dynasty of the Pharaohs,”
Zeta Phalos began, while all listened intently.
“I have reason to believe that they exist in the
vicinity of the Valley of the Kings and have
never been discovered or uncovered.”</p>

<p>“The Valley of the Kings!” exclaimed Don.
“Why, that’s where we’re going in search of
my father.”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” replied Phalos. “And where
I’m going, too, if you are good enough to let
me form one of your party.”</p>

<p>“With the greatest of pleasure,” assented
Professor Bruce, while the captain nodded his
head in vigorous agreement. “Your knowledge
of the place will be invaluable to us, to
say nothing of the pleasure we will have from
your company.”</p>

<p>Phalos inclined his head in courteous acknowledgment.</p>

<p>“But I thought,” said the captain, “that
practically all of the tombs of the great rulers
of Egypt had been discovered and explored.”</p>

<p>The Egyptian shook his head.</p>

<p>“Not all,” he said. “A great many have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
been opened by scientists and their treasures
lie now in the great museums and libraries of
the old world. Others have been broken into
by thieves and the tombs despoiled of gold and
gems which were sold secretly to whoever
would buy. But great treasures still await the
excavators, as is proved by the recent discovery
of the tomb of Tut-ankh-Amen.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes,” broke in the professor, “that is
the greatest of them all. I am counting on examining
that when we get to Luxor.”</p>

<p>“The greatest of them all so far,” qualified
Phalos. “But if I am not mistaken, a still
greater remains to be discovered. Great heaps
of gold and jewels that have dazzled the eyes
and the imaginations of the world have been
found in Tut-ankh-Amen’s tomb. But they will
be surpassed, I think, if we ever discover the
Tombs of Gold.”</p>

<p>“The Tombs of Gold!” ejaculated the professor,
while Don and Teddy looked at each
other significantly. “Isn’t that rather an extravagant
description? Do you really mean of
gold?”</p>

<p>“Just that,” replied Phalos soberly. “Not
the tombs themselves, perhaps, but the coffins
and pillars and implements placed there for
the use of the dead.”</p>

<p>“Just what monarch was buried there?”
asked the professor, with just the faintest
tinge of skepticism in his tone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>“You have heard, of course, of Ras-Ameses,”
replied Phalos.</p>

<p>“Surely,” replied the professor, with quickened
interest. “The richest and most powerful
ruler of one of the oldest dynasties who
extended his reign over all of Libya and
Ethiopia. The one who is supposed first to
have worked the mines of Ophir.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” assented Phalos, “the one whose
palace was filled with gold and silver ornaments,
whose bed was of solid gold and whose
barbaric splendor has never had a parallel
among the rulers of the East.”</p>

<p>“Gee,” murmured Don, while Teddy’s lips
puckered for a whistle which he did not emit.</p>

<p>“And you will remember, too, that his tomb
has never been discovered,” continued Zeta
Phalos.</p>

<p>“That is so,” agreed the professor. “It has
been the dream of archæologists to find it, but
all of them have been forced to give it up in
despair.”</p>

<p>“That,” pronounced Phalos, with a tincture
of pride in the solemnity of his tone, “is the
tomb that I expect to find.”</p>

<p>The Americans looked at him, startled, and,
despite themselves, were a little incredulous.</p>

<p>“It will be one of the greatest triumphs of
modern discovery if you do,” replied the professor,
after a moment.</p>

<p>“What makes you think you have a clue to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
its whereabouts?” asked Don, in deep interest.</p>

<p>“It is a curious story,” replied Phalos, smiling
at the boy. “One of the romances of
archæology.</p>

<p>“Many years ago, when I was still strong
and vigorous, I was riding in a remote part of
the Valley of the Kings. Above me towered a
great overhanging cliff that cast a grateful
shadow over the road and prompted me to get
off my horse and rest there while I had my
midday meal.</p>

<p>“The place was off from the beaten road of
travel, and there was nothing to distract my attention.
I lay there after my meal for a while,
stretched out on my back, looking up idly at the
great face of the cliff. At a height of perhaps
three hundred feet, I could make out what
seemed to be carvings or symbols of some sort.</p>

<p>“While I was looking, a piece of stone fell
off the surface and dropped almost at my feet.
I picked it up and saw curious hieroglyphics
on it. I was an ardent student of the ancient
writings, and had no trouble in making out the
name of Ras-Ameses.”</p>

<p>Professor Bruce gave vent to an exclamation.</p>

<p>“That made the blood thrill in my veins,”
resumed Phalos. “I knew, of course, the
mystery that had always veiled the last resting
place of that monarch, and it seemed as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
though chance had placed the key to the puzzle
in my hands.</p>

<p>“Right then and there, I resolved to follow
the matter up. I made my way up the almost
perpendicular side of the cliff, with only my
hands and feet to aid me, until I reached a
narrow ledge, where the old stone masons must
have stood when they first made the inscription.
It was risky work, for a slip would have
meant certain death.</p>

<p>“I could copy part of the inscription from
there, but a time soon came when I had to
have a ladder to climb further. I had to drag
the ladder up with a rope and place it in
position almost upright on the ledge perpendicularly
against the face of the rock. The
least little movement on my part would have
overbalanced and plunged me outward and
down to the foot of the cliff.”</p>

<p>“Risky work!” exclaimed the captain, looking
at the old Egyptian with the look in his eyes
that one brave man has for another.</p>

<p>“I was young, and perhaps foolhardy, then,”
replied Phalos. “I remember one day when I
escaped death almost by a miracle. I was on
the ladder which I had thrown, equipped with
hooks, over a rocky ledge above me. Suddenly
the lower part of the ladder broke and I was
left clutching the upper part and swinging over
the precipice. I had to pull myself up hand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
over hand on the upper rungs until I reached
to the top and safety.”</p>

<p>“A mighty close call!” ejaculated Don, who
was following the narration with breathless
interest.</p>

<p>“Somewhat,” agreed Phalos, with a smile.
“But I finally copied the inscription and
brought it home to study it. It proved to be one
of the boastful inscriptions of his power and
glory that Ras-Ameses had probably composed
before his death, leaving orders that it should
be inscribed where it would probably endure
for ages. The fact that it was in a place where
it might never be read made no difference.
What he was concerned with was its eternity.
The gods at least would have a record of his
exploits.</p>

<p>“He enumerates his vast wealth and gives a
description of the treasures he had ordered to
be placed in his tomb, where other members of
the royal family also were buried or to be
buried. There were golden chariots, which he
expected to drive in the future world. There
were golden beds, on which he expected to recline.
There were gem-studded vases of alabaster
containing precious perfumes and ointments.
There was a golden boat that would be
used in ferrying him over the dark waters of
the underworld. And all of these are described
with a definiteness and particularity that carry
conviction.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>He paused and looked about him.</p>

<p>“But where are the tombs containing all
these treasures?” asked Don breathlessly, before
the others, equally excited, could speak.</p>

<p>“As to that I have only indications,” was
the reply. “The references to them are vague
and mysterious in the inscription. But there
is enough to make me feel sure that with patience
and the proper assistants I can eventually
find them.”</p>

<p>The professor cleared his throat.</p>

<p>“Are you sure that you are the only man
alive who possesses these clews?” he asked.</p>

<p>Zeta Phalos was silent for a moment.</p>

<p>“As far as I know, I am,” he replied. “And
yet,” he went on, with some slight hesitation,
“I have sometimes suspected that one other
man might have the key to the secret.”</p>

<p>“Who is that?” asked the captain quickly.</p>

<p>“Richard Sturdy,” was the answer.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

<small><span class="smcap">In Great Danger</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was a gasp from the members of the
party at Zeta Phalos’ words, and Don bounded
to his feet.</p>

<p>“My father!” he cried.</p>

<p>“What makes you think my brother knew
anything about this?” asked the captain, with
as much agitation as he ever permitted himself
to show.</p>

<p>“Mr. Sturdy and I were firm friends when
he was here on his first exploring expedition,”
replied Phalos. “I admired him because of
his fine intellect; and then, too, his passion for
research along the same lines as my own drew
us together. Many a time he has been a guest
in my home, and, seated right on this balcony,
we have discussed the things we had in common.
More than once we had spoken of
Ras-Ameses and the mystery concerning his
burial place. I had at that time made my discovery
of the inscription, but was keeping it a
safely guarded secret.</p>

<p>“It happened that we were once both at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
Valley of the Kings at the same time, though
with different parties. One day, while riding
along at the foot of the cliff on which I had discovered
the inscription, a piece of paper fluttered
down from the rock. I wondered where
it could have come from. I picked it up and
found that it bore creases in it that resembled
hieroglyphics. I knew that they formed part
of the inscription. You can imagine something
of my surprise and consternation at the thought
that perhaps some one else was the sharer of
my secret.</p>

<p>“I had a pair of powerful glasses with me
and unslung them and focused them upon the
rock. I could distinctly see other bits of paper
on various portions of the inscription. Then
I understood, and, although I was chagrined,
I was filled with admiration for some one’s
ingenuity.</p>

<p>“The man, whoever it was, had approached
the matter from the top of the cliff. He had
wet broad sheets of paper and lowered them
from the top with a flat board behind them so
as to press them against the inscription. The
letters made creases in the wet paper. As soon
as the paper was dry, he had drawn it up
and probably filled in the creases with ink or
pencil. Thus he would eventually have a complete
copy of the inscription, and could decipher
it at his leisure.”</p>

<p>“An extremely ingenious method,” commented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
the professor, “and one that makes me
proud of my brother-in-law, if he were the
author.”</p>

<p>“What makes you think that my father was
the one who did it?” asked Don.</p>

<p>“My thought would have leaped to him at
once because of his brilliancy,” replied Phalos.
“But I had something a little more definite
than that. I turned over the bit of paper I
had in my hand and saw that a name had been
scribbled on it. Only a few of the letters remained,
but I could make out ‘urdy.’”</p>

<p>“Fairly conclusive,” agreed the captain.</p>

<p>“Later on, when I met Mr. Sturdy,” resumed
Phalos, “I could see that he was intensely
excited over something. I tried to sound him
out casually, but he evaded me. I was sure
that he had made what he thought was a great
discovery.”</p>

<p>“That’s what he must have had in mind
when he kept talking to mother about the
Tombs of Gold!” exclaimed Don.</p>

<p>“Did he really speak of them?” asked
Phalos, much interested. “That goes still further
toward confirming my suspicion. The
thought that had been with him on and off for
years must have taken full possession of him
when his mind became deranged, to the exclusion
of everything else.”</p>

<p>“That makes it all the more likely,” observed
the captain, “that we’ll find him somewhere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
in the vicinity of the Valley of the
Kings, where the inscription was discovered.”</p>

<p>“Precisely so,” agreed the old Egyptian.
“However, the search may lead him far afield,
for I have reason to believe that the tombs
themselves are at some distance from the place
where the inscription was found. That inscription
was placed there because the towering
cliff offered the spot where it was most likely
to endure for ages.”</p>

<p>“It was certainly a lucky day for us when
we met you on the steamer,” declared Don enthusiastically.</p>

<p>“A luckier day for me,” returned Phalos,
with a smile. “Is it understood then?” he
asked, turning to Don’s uncles, “that we join
hands and prosecute our search together?”</p>

<p>“Most gladly on our part,” replied the captain
and the professor in one breath.</p>

<p>“Then we’ll consider it settled,” said the old
Egyptian. “I have a steam dahabiyeh moored
in the river, and if you are agreeable, we will
sail on that up the river to Luxor. I think you
will find it the most pleasant mode of traveling,
and there will be plenty of room for the baggage
and supplies we shall need to take along.”</p>

<p>“That will be fine,” replied the captain.
“And who knows but that the wishes of all our
hearts may be fulfilled in the finding of my
brother and also of the Tombs of Gold.”</p>

<p>“All things are in the hands of Allah,” replied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
Phalos, who, although a cosmopolite,
clung to the formula of his Mohammedan faith.</p>

<p>The next two days were busy ones for the
adults of the party, as much had to be purchased
in the way of implements and supplies
for what might prove a long sojourn in the
desert.</p>

<p>Don and Teddy had a good deal of time on
their hands, and the professor suggested that
they go out to Gizeh to see the Pyramids and
the Sphinx. They needed no urging, for these
mighty wonders of the world had long made a
strong appeal to their imaginations. The boys
had seen them pictured many times, but that
was nothing compared to seeing the marvelous
constructions that were old when Rome was
young, and under whose shadows Cæsar and
Napoleon had paced and been reminded of their
own littleness.</p>

<p>Their elders were too busy to go with them,
and besides had seen them before. So Don
and Teddy secured a native guide and rode on
donkeys toward the massive creations, the
greatest built by human hands, that loomed up
in the brightness of the Egyptian sunshine.</p>

<p>They were prepared to be impressed, but
that word was too weak to express their feeling
of awe when they stood before the largest
pyramid of the three and gazed aloft at its
towering top. Overpowered would have come
nearer to their actual state of mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>There the greatest of the three pyramids,
that of King Cheops, reared itself toward the
skies, originally nearly five hundred feet in
height and with a base so broad that the boys
had to trudge through the sands for half a
mile before they had compassed it. It stood
there, apparently as immutable as time itself,
a tremendous monument of the great civilization
that had once flourished on the banks of
the Nile.</p>

<p>“How on earth could they build anything
like that?” asked Teddy, under his breath.</p>

<p>“Uncle Amos says that nobody knows,” replied
Don. “He says that it’s doubtful
whether modern engineers could do it at all,
even with the tools they have to-day and that
they didn’t have when these were built six
thousand years ago. Probably it was done
almost altogether by man power.</p>

<p>“Uncle Amos says that it took a hundred
thousand men ten years just to build the sloping
road that led up to it. And it took that
many men thirty years to build this one Pyramid.
They must have had ropes with thousands
of men hauling the stones along on
rollers and then pulling them up and piling
them on each other.”</p>

<p>“If one of the ropes broke, the stones
tumbling down must have crushed hundreds at
a time,” remarked Teddy. “I guess it wasn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
peaches and cream to be a laborer in those
days.”</p>

<p>“I guess not,” agreed Don. “Little old
America is good enough for me.”</p>

<p>Five hundred yards away from the Great
Pyramid was the head of the Sphinx, that lion-bodied,
human-headed mystery of the ages,
carved out of the mother rock that forms the
floor of the desert. Nearly two hundred feet
from the tip of its paws to the end of its
back, it rose sixty-five feet in the air, gazing
out over the desert in immutable stony silence.</p>

<p>“What that could tell if it could speak,”
murmured Don.</p>

<p>After some further explorations the two
boys turned toward the city, which lay white-walled
and glittering in the afternoon sun.</p>

<p>That evening the captain, looking over one
of his suitcases, noted the absence of one of
his revolvers.</p>

<p>“I was cleaning and oiling some of my
weapons down in the dahabiyeh,” he said, after
looking about fruitlessly for a time. “I
thought I’d brought them all back here but I
must have left that 38-caliber there. Would
you mind running down there, Don, and taking
a look for it? You’ll find one of the men in
charge.”</p>

<p>“Sure, I will,” responded Don, and went off
at once.</p>

<p>The dahabiyeh of Zeta Phalos was perhaps a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
quarter of a mile away moored to a wharf.
Don had already visited it that morning, and
had no trouble in reaching it. The native
watchman, Ismillah, greeted him with a smile
that showed all his gleaming teeth and helped
Don look for the revolver, that had slipped behind
one of the cushions.</p>

<p>With a word of thanks, Don turned to go
back. As in most ports, the district along the
waterfront was low and disreputable. The
streets were narrow and ill-lighted.</p>

<p>As Don was passing along one of the darkest
of the streets, two men stepped out from
an alley and confronted him.</p>

<p>Don’s heart gave a sudden bound as he recognized
them.</p>

<p>They were Tezra and Nepahak!</p>

<small><span class="smcap">A Dash for Liberty</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> the rascals had been waiting for Don
was evident from the fact that they showed no
surprise at the meeting. On the contrary, there
was a look of evil determination on their faces
that betrayed a deliberate plan. It was evident
that they had been lurking about the Phalos
villa, had seen the boy depart, noted his route
and planned to waylay him on his return.</p>

<p>“So here you are,” snarled Tezra, thrusting
his face close to Don’s.</p>

<p>“Don’t seem to be anywhere else, do I?”
answered Don, with an airiness that he was far
from feeling.</p>

<p>“You will wish you were, before we get
through with you,” growled Nepahak, at the
same time putting his hand to his belt.</p>

<p>Don had been thinking rapidly. Had the revolver
he was carrying in his pocket been
loaded, it would have put him more on a par
with his enemies. But it contained no cartridges.
He had seen that when he picked it up.</p>

<p>Revolvers, however, have more uses than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
one. Don, who was as quick as lightning,
plucked it from his pocket and threw it with
all his force at Tezra’s head. It struck that
worthy full between the eyes, and he went down
with a crash.</p>

<p>Scarcely waiting to see the result of the blow,
Don lashed out with both fists at Nepahak.
The latter had been staggered at the sudden
downfall of his more dominant companion, to
whom he played the role of jackal. He had no
stomach for punishment, and, bewildered by
the storm of blows that Don rained on him,
made scarcely more than a pretext at resistance.
In a moment he had turned and made
off with as much speed as his short legs could
master.</p>

<p>Tezra was trying to stagger to his feet. Had
he been unconscious, Don would have stayed
and done what he could for him, even though
he was his enemy. As it was, Don picked up
the revolver, with a mental blessing for the service
it had rendered him, and hurried away
until he had reached a broad and brightly
lighted thoroughfare. Then he abated his speed,
though still walking rapidly, until he reached
the villa of Phalos.</p>

<p>“What’s up?” asked his Uncle Frank
quickly, as he noted Don’s panting breath and
his flushed face.</p>

<p>“Had a run in with those two beauties, Tezra
and Nepahak,” explained Don, sinking into a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
chair and tossing the revolver on the table.</p>

<p>“Tezra and Nepahak!” exclaimed the professor.
“Have those birds of evil omen turned
up again?”</p>

<p>“Very much so,” answered Don.</p>

<p>“Are you hurt?” asked the captain anxiously.</p>

<p>“Not a bit,” was the answer. “Only winded.
I beat it out of the neighborhood while the
going was good.”</p>

<p>“What became of the skunks?” asked Brick.</p>

<p>“The last I saw of them, Nepahak was legging
it down the street and Tezra was just
getting up from the sidewalk.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you’ve been fighting again,”
said Brick, in mock reproof but with vast delight.</p>

<p>“Tell us just what happened,” urged Professor
Bruce.</p>

<p>“Those fellows stepped out of a dark alley
and held me up,” replied Don. “Told me they
were going to make me wish I was somewhere
else. As a matter of fact, that’s just what I
was wishing. I might have parleyed with them,
but Nepahak was reaching for a knife. I remembered
what you’ve told me about getting
in the first blow, Uncle Frank, so I soaked
Tezra with the revolver. Then I lammed into
Nepahak, and he started running. I thought
that was a good thing, so I started running
too—in the opposite direction. That’s all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>“That’s all!” mimicked Brick. “Knocked
the daylights out of both of them. That’s all!”</p>

<p>“It seems to be quite enough,” said the professor,
with a smile.</p>

<p>“You’re all there, my boy, and I’m proud
of you. Trust the Sturdys to give a good account
of themselves and live up to their name,”
observed the captain. “But it makes me uneasy
to learn that Tezra and Nepahak have
turned up again. I’m afraid it bodes no good
for our friend Phalos or the purpose of our
expedition.”</p>

<p>Their host came in at that moment and
caught the names of his enemies.</p>

<p>“What is it I hear about them?” he asked,
with a worried face. “Are they in Cairo?”</p>

<p>“They were, up to a few minutes ago,” replied
Don, and repeated the essential parts
of his adventure. Phalos listened intently.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you came so well out of it,” he
remarked, when Don had finished. “But it
simply shows that my foreboding was correct
when I told you they would not easily relinquish
their purpose. It is possible that they
meant to extort from you all that you knew
about our proposed trip and then do away with
you. The river was close at hand, and it has
served as a cover for many tragedies.”</p>

<p>“Could you not set the police on their tracks
and put the villains in jail?” queried the professor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>“I suppose I could,” replied Phalos. “But
I hesitate to do that, because of the publicity
that would attend to it. The reason for their
attempts on me and this last attack on Don
might come to light, and it would thus become
known that I have this secret about the Tombs
of Gold, or that Tezra and Nepahak suspect I
have. And I want to keep that from the public
at all hazards.”</p>

<p>“How did those fellows learn that you had
such a secret?” asked Don, voicing a question
that had been more than once in the mind of
each member of the party.</p>

<p>“I lay it to a thievish servant I once had,”
returned their host. “I made two copies of the
inscription. One of these I kept always locked
in the safe, of which I alone know the combination.
The other was also usually deposited in
the safe, but I took it out frequently to study
it.</p>

<p>“One day, when I was looking it over, I was
summoned suddenly out of the room on urgent
business. Shortly after I returned I found
that one of the sheets was missing. I searched
for it everywhere, but could find no trace of
it. I examined all the servants. All denied
any knowledge of it. But one of them was so
evasive and flustered that I felt sure he was
the guilty one. I caught him later directly in
the act of stealing household articles and discharged
him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>“And your theory about the missing sheet
is what?” asked the professor.</p>

<p>“That the man, knowing the store I set by
the manuscript, stole it with the idea of selling
it,” replied Phalos. “He did not dare to take
it all, but thought that one sheet would not be
missed. Some time later I saw him on the
street in close consultation with Tezra and
Nepahak, who have an evil reputation in this
city.”</p>

<p>“What was on the missing sheet?” asked
the captain.</p>

<p>“Just enough to tell that the inscription bore
on the tombs of Ras-Ameses,” replied Phalos.
“Everybody in Egypt knows that his
tomb has never been discovered and that it is
supposed to contain fabulous riches. Luckily
there was nothing on the stolen paper giving
the slightest clue as to where the tomb was to
be found.”</p>

<p>“That was a bit of luck, but a precious one,”
observed Professor Bruce.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Phalos, nodding his head.
“But it was easy to jump to the conclusion that
the rest of the manuscript told the story that
the thieves were so anxious to know. They felt
sure that I was in possession of the secret.
Hence their persistent attempts to wrest it from
me.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said the captain. “Tezra and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
Nepahak believed that if they could find that
tomb they would be rich for life.”</p>

<p>“And I have no doubt they would,” returned
their host. “Rich beyond the dreams
of avarice.”</p>

<p>“Well, they’ll have a sweet time getting the
best of us,” boasted Don.</p>

<p>The captain laughed, then, the look coming
into his eyes that more than once had made his
enemies quail, he observed:</p>

<p>“You are right, Don. They certainly will.”</p>

<p>“I believe it,” said Phalos, with a courteous
inclination of his head. “And my mind is more
at rest than it has been for months, now that I
have such valuable reinforcements. All we can
do now is to keep our eyes open and deal with
those rascals as opportunity offers.”</p>

<p>By the next afternoon, the preparations of
the party were completed, and they embarked
on the dahabiyeh, which was manned by a crew
in which the owner had complete confidence.</p>

<p>Their voyage up the storied river was replete
with beauty and romance. All the glory
of ancient Egypt seemed embodied in that wonderful
stream, that is in some respects the most
remarkable river in the world. The senses of
the Americans were fairly steeped in its glamour
and mystery as they sat under the awnings
in the day, with the sunlight falling on
the rippling surface and reflected in a thousand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
diamond glints, or at night, when the full
moon flooded it with solemn splendor.</p>

<p>But the witchery of the mighty river could
not divert Don’s thoughts from his father.</p>

<p>Was he still alive? Had he succumbed to
hardships? Was he wandering bewildered and
dazed under the scorching suns of that foreign
country? What had befallen him? Where
would they find him, if they found him at all?
And even if he were discovered and taken
home, would all the skill in the world be able to
restore the splendid mind he had been dowered
with at birth?</p>

<p>All these questions kept tormenting Don
without ceasing, and he had a furious impatience
for the end of the journey. His heart
leaped with joy when they finally reached
Luxor, on the site of the former city of Thebes,
the magnificent capital in ancient times of the
kingdom of Egypt.</p>

<p>Dusk was still lingering in the sky when the
dahabiyeh drew up to the city, but it was still
light enough to see across the river the massive
cliffs that hemmed in the Valley of the Kings,
that royal mausoleum of scores of great rulers
who had had to bow to a stronger hand than
theirs, and yet even in death clung to the relics
of their pomp and power.</p>

<p>Don thrilled as he looked at those towering
cliffs. At their base was the far-famed Valley
of the Kings. The words that had been so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
often on his father’s lips! The valley where
even now his father might be laboring feverishly,
following what? A genuine light or a
mere will o’ the wisp?</p>

<p>The boy could scarcely wait till daylight, and
almost as soon as the dawn had reddened the
sky he and the rest of his party, only less
eager than himself, were afoot and getting
ready for their trip.</p>

<p>They breakfasted well at the excellent hotel
kept for the accommodation of tourists from
all over the world who yearly visit the far-famed
spot and who just then were in greater
force than usual, drawn by the wonderful discoveries
recently made at the tomb of Tut-ankh-Amen.</p>

<p>There was still a certain freshness in the
morning air when, after breakfast, the party
set out; but by the time they had crossed the
river the sun was beginning to make itself felt,
and by the time they had reached the celebrated
valley it was beating down on them with
a fierceness that reminded them of the Sahara.</p>

<p>At last the huge piles of rubble and débris
that testified to the work of the diggers apprized
them of the approach to the most wonderful
cemetery on earth.</p>

<p>A more desolate spot it would be hard to
imagine. There was not the slightest trace of
vegetation, not a tree, not a flower, not a blade
of grass. The birds avoided it, and the only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
trace of animal life was found in the bats that
haunted the tombs in myriads.</p>

<p>But there was plenty of human life in evidence,
men guarding the tombs and scores of
others digging in the foothills that rose until
they were lost in the mountainous cliffs that
rimmed the valley.</p>

<p>The searching party passed the wonderful
temple of Queen Hatshepsut, with its rows of
pillars standing like sentinels against the dark
mountain masses beyond. Soon they were at
the tomb of Tut-ankh-Amen, the most remarkable
discovery of its kind in modern times.</p>

<p>Don had already heard of the romantic history
of that discovery, how the hidden site had
been passed over again and again, how for over
sixteen years Lord Carnarvon and Howard
Carter had toiled among those dreary wastes,
and how at last, when hope had almost been
abandoned, the stubbing of a toe had revealed
a step that led down into the tomb that proved
a veritable treasure trove which threw all previous
discoveries in the shade.</p>

<p>Now, with his companions, he gazed with
fascinated interest on the many treasures that
still remained, though most of them had been
packed and sent to Cairo for safe keeping.
They penetrated into the inner shrine and had
a mere glimpse of the sarcophagus, at that
time still unopened, that was believed to contain
the mummy of the monarch who once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
reigned supreme over Upper and Lower
Egypt.</p>

<p>“Think what it must have meant,” said the
professor, who of all the party, with the possible
exception of Phalos, most fully grasped
the stupendous importance of the discovery,
“when after all those years of strenuous toil
and bitter disappointment, the discoverers
penetrated into the outer chamber of the tomb.</p>

<p>“Their eyes were fairly dazzled by the
wealth revealed to them. Its money value
could be counted in millions, but it was not
of this they were chiefly thinking. There were
beautifully carved beds inlaid with ivory and
semi-precious stones, golden sandals, chariots
encrusted with gold and jewels, statues holding
golden maces, chairs of ebony and ivory
vases of alabaster and scores of other treasures
so rich as to be almost unbelievable.</p>

<p>“Then there was a multitude of other things,
which, while not so intrinsically valuable, were
of immense importance in showing the life and
customs of ancient Egypt—musical instruments,
toys, clothes and robes for all occasions.
There were rolls of papyri, which are expected,
when deciphered, to add enormously to our
knowledge of the times of the Pharaohs. And
there were provisions for the dead on the last
journey, trussed ducks, haunches of venison, all
packed in the boxes where they were laid away
by the royal chef, thirty-three centuries ago.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>Teddy nudged Don.</p>

<p>“The Egyptians had some good ideas,” he
ventured in a whisper. “That last idea about
the ducks and venison hits me hard.”</p>

<p>“What did you say?” asked the professor,
stopping short.</p>

<p>“I—I said the Egyptians had some good
ideas,” stammered Teddy, a flush suffusing his
face.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br>

<small><span class="smcap">The Night Prowler</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">I’m</span> glad you are so interested,” said Professor
Bruce innocently. “Many of the people
who come here have no real appreciation of
what they see or hear. Their souls don’t rise
above material things.”</p>

<p>Don gave Teddy a vigorous poke in the ribs
that luckily passed unnoticed.</p>

<p>There were other tombs in the vicinity, that
of Seti I and Amenophis II, the latter lying
extended on his sarcophagus in the full glare
of an electric light that seemed altogether too
modern to be in harmony with a dwelling of
the dead.</p>

<p>It was singular that the scene should have
left no sense of depression on the spectators,
such as they would have felt had they been in
a modern cemetery. But so many centuries
had elapsed that the tombs and their contents
seemed to them merely historical relics. The
haze of ages enveloped them. It was hard for
them to think that the dried-up mummies had
once been breathing living figures, that before
these kings, whom the superstitious people regarded
as gods, thousands had bowed in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
adoration, that upon their word hung the issues
of life and death.</p>

<p>So it was with the feeling of being in a great
museum that they passed from one to the other
of the great monuments of antiquity adding
momentarily to their knowledge of the mighty
civilization that had flourished there in the
dawn of recorded history, thousands of years
before America had been discovered.</p>

<p>“Seems to me that the Egyptians thought
more about dying than they did about living,”
commented Don.</p>

<p>“It would seem so at first sight,” conceded
the professor. “As a matter of fact, they got
a good deal of enjoyment out of life. That is,
the wealthier classes did. It must be admitted
that the life of the poorer people was hard,
much like that of the coolies of China to-day.
But those with more money seemed to have indulged
in all the pleasures that money could
buy. The paintings on the walls of the palaces
and temples show them at banquets, at races,
engaged in hunting, and in all manner of
sports.”</p>

<p>“Why did they pay so much attention to
their tombs, then?” asked Don.</p>

<p>“That was a result of their religion,” replied
his Uncle Amos. “It was of the greatest
importance that the body should be preserved
after death. The Egyptians believed
that every human being possessed a double that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
was a perfect duplicate of himself, and that the
life of the double depended upon having a body
to return to after its journey to the other
world. If the double came back and found the
body gone, it would perish. And the loss of
immortality was too dreadful a thing to contemplate.
That’s why they took so much pains
to embalm the body.”</p>

<p>“Why did they have statues of the dead man
in the tomb?” asked Don.</p>

<p>“That was to ‘play safe,’ as you would call
it,” answered the professor, with a smile.
“There was always a chance that the body
might be destroyed. In that case, the next best
thing would be to have a likeness of the dead
man for the double to come back into. And in
order that the double shouldn’t make a mistake,
they painted the likeness of the man on
the statue.”</p>

<p>“So that the double wouldn’t get in the
wrong pew,” murmured Teddy, but taking
care this time that he should not be heard by
his elders.</p>

<p>“In the case of kings,” continued the professor,
“there were usually several statues, so
that if one were broken or stolen he would still
have a chance for a future life.”</p>

<p>“What was the idea of putting the provisions
in the tomb?” asked Don, giving Teddy
a surreptitious poke.</p>

<p>“Because the Egyptians believed that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
needs of the future would be very similar to
those of the present,” was the reply. “The
soul, or double, would need food and drink just
the same as the person did here. So jars of
water and plenty of bread and meat were
placed beside the mummy.</p>

<p>“Then, too, the rich man would need servants
to wait on him. So they made little
statuettes that were supposed to go with the
double and do his work. The double would
need a barge or other kind of boat to ferry him
over the holy waters to the Fields of the
Blessed. That was the reason for the boat that
you saw in the tomb of Tut-ankh-Amen.”</p>

<p>“How about the people who were too poor
to do that kind of thing?” asked Don.</p>

<p>“They got around it by having pictures of
those things, the food and boats and other necessaries
painted on the walls of the tomb,” answered
his uncle.</p>

<p>“Not much nourishment in that,” Teddy
whispered to Don.</p>

<p>“Those manuscripts you saw,” continued
the professor, “were what is called the ‘Book
of the Dead.’ They told the dead man what
answers to give when he stood before Osiris,
the supreme judge who weighed his character
and decided whether he was worthy to enter
Paradise. Among other things, he was instructed
to say: ‘I have not stolen’; ‘I have
not lied’; ‘I have not killed.’ You see the general<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
idea of what was right and what was
wrong was very much the same then as it is
now.”</p>

<p>The time passed quickly, and when the party
emerged from the latest of the tombs they had
visited, the sun was high in the heavens and
the valley was like an oven.</p>

<p>As they passed the different gangs of diggers
they made inquiries of the overseers regarding
Mr. Sturdy. The officials listened with
courtesy, and in some cases with interest, but
none of them could give any information.
None could be found who had seen such a man
as Phalos or Professor Bruce described. Nor
had they heard the name. The latter of course
was not surprising, for, as Don bitterly reflected,
his father did not even know his own
name.</p>

<p>“No help to be gained from these sources,”
the captain summed up after a series of disheartening
experiences. “It’s strictly up to us
to do the finding ourselves. Now let’s get back
to Luxor and make our final preparations.”</p>

<p>There were many other wonders in the vicinity
that under other circumstances the lads,
especially, would have liked to visit, such
as the Colossi of Memnon, the Temple of Karnak,
but everything else must be abandoned or
deferred in their overwhelming desire to find
Don’s father.</p>

<p>There had been much debate among the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
members of the party as to the motive power
of the expedition. The captain, remembering
the value of the automobiles in their Sahara
trip, would have preferred them. But inquiry
both at Cairo and at Luxor had shown them
that there was none to be had of the
type wanted, and the ordinary kind without the
caterpillar tread, would have been of no use in
the desert.</p>

<p>Had they expected their search to be confined
entirely to the Valley of the Kings, they
would have used donkeys, the common mode of
travel in that vicinity. But this idea also was
abandoned, because of the supplies that would
be needed for the animals.</p>

<p>So they finally decided on camels, the “ships
of the desert,” whose padded hoofs seemed especially
made to travel the sandy wastes and
who could go for days without water in case
of necessity.</p>

<p>The captain and the professor, in their frequent
journeys in Oriental countries, had
learned to ride the beasts without difficulty.
Teddy, too, during the time he was in charge
of the Algerian, Alam Bokaru, master of
camels, had become fairly expert.</p>

<p>To Don, however, though he had occasionally
mounted one of the brutes, it was something to
be mastered. But as they had to remain at
Luxor for a couple of days, owing to the delay
in receiving the permit for excavations, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
which Zeta Phalos had applied to the Egyptian
Government, he had plenty of time to learn
and had soon conquered the swaying, sickening
sensations that beset the novice.</p>

<p>Who should accompany the party had been
a subject of much thought on the part of
Phalos.</p>

<p>“I do not think that we shall have to do
much digging,” he said, as he was discussing
the matter with the captain and the professor.
“If my indications are correct, it will be a matter
of finding a certain entrance rather among
the rocks than the sands. And the main thing,
anyway, is to find that entrance. If we find
that much excavation is needed, we can retrace
our steps and get a force of laborers. In
the meantime, the fewer we have with us, the
better our chances of not having our secret betrayed.”</p>

<p>“Right you are,” agreed the captain.</p>

<p>“But we shall need some one to take care of
the animals, shan’t we?” asked Don, who was
standing near.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Phalos, smiling on the eager,
level-headed boy. “And for that purpose I
have fixed on Ismillah and Abdul. They have
been in my household for years. Their fathers
served my father. They are absolutely trustworthy
and devoted to me. Ismillah is an excellent
cook and handy man, and Abdul knows
all there is to be known about camels.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>So it was settled, and after the permits had
arrived and all the supplies secured that would
be needed for the trip, the searchers set out on
their double quest—to seek for Mr. Sturdy and
for the Tombs of Gold.</p>

<p>The first was by far the most important, to
the Americans of the party at least, and it was
to this they gave their chief attention.</p>

<p>They traversed the Valley of the Kings,
stopping at every place where excavations were
going on to make inquiries of the foremen in
charge. But always the answer was in the
negative, until a doubt began to creep into
Don’s mind whether his father had ever
reached the spot that had possessed so strong
a fascination for his deranged mind. When
two days had thus been passed fruitlessly,
this doubt became almost a conviction.</p>

<p>In the course of their journeying, they
passed the cliff from which Phalos had copied
the inscription. It was at a dizzy height, and
increased their respect for the man who had
dared its perils.</p>

<p>The captain unslung his field glasses and
passed them around, so that all could have a
look at the curious writing that had withstood
the centuries. They studied it with interest,
Don far more acutely than that of any other
member of the party, because of his belief that
his father had also risked his life in securing
a copy of those queer hieroglyphics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>“How on earth could any one read such
writings?” asked Teddy.</p>

<p>“They couldn’t up to a little more than a
hundred years ago,” replied Zeta Phalos, with
a smile. “The knowledge of it had passed
utterly out of the mind of man for nearly two
thousand years.</p>

<p>“Then, at the time Napoleon was in Egypt,
one of his engineers in digging a fort uncovered
a stone, not much bigger than you could
carry in your hands, that had on it three different
kinds of writing. One was Greek, another
was in the writing of the common people
of old Egypt, and the third was in the writing
used by the Egyptian priesthood similar to
what you see up there. The stone was called
the Rosetta stone, and is now in the British
Museum.</p>

<p>“Of course, the Greek could be read, and
scholars were struck by the idea that the other
inscriptions referred to the same thing. So
they compared the Greek with the other characters
and so learned what the symbols meant.
That was the beginning, and before long they
had an old Egyptian grammar and dictionary.
That little stone proved to be the key that unlocked
the whole vast storehouse of Egyptian
history.”</p>

<p>As they moved on the surroundings gradually
assumed a desert character. The cliffs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
grew lower and were in many places replaced
by sand dunes.</p>

<p>Don’s attention was attracted by the countless
little heaps of stones they passed, each consisting
of a little upright slab of rock, held in
place by others on each side.</p>

<p>“What are those, Uncle Amos?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Prayer stones,” answered the professor,
after a casual glance. “They are the prayers
of travelers to the gods of their city that they
might have a prosperous journey. Those fragments
of pottery indicate that a bowl, probably
containing water, was set beside each
pile.”</p>

<p>“A prosperous journey,” mused Don, as he
thought of the object of his own search, and
though he did not erect a similar pile, there
was a prayer in his heart.</p>

<p>On the night of the second day they made
their preparations to pitch camp. A tent was
soon erected, and while Abdul fed, watered and
tethered the camels, Ismillah prepared a meal
that fully justified his master’s opinion of him
as a cook.</p>

<p>After supper, the travelers stretched themselves
out on the sands, enjoying the faint
breeze that had sprung up after sunset and
studying the splendor of the Egyptian sky,
studded with stars that glowed like so many
jewels. Above them spread the Milky Way,
like a spray of silver dust.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>“The Nile of the heavens,” murmured the
professor.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked Don.</p>

<p>“The old Egyptians considered the Milky
Way the Nile of the future life,” was the answer.
“They used to fancy that the departed
ones were sailing up and down that, just as
they used to sail the Nile when they were
alive.”</p>

<p>“Quite a poetical fancy,” remarked the captain.</p>

<p>“How nice and homelike,” said the irreverent
Teddy. “You could just look up and say,
‘There goes Aunt Jemima.’”</p>

<p>The professor looked rather shocked, but the
captain laughed.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you’re a hopeless case, Teddy,”
he said. “But now I guess we’d better turn
in. We want to get an early start to-morrow
before the sun becomes too hot.”</p>

<p>His suggestion was followed and all except
Don were soon sound asleep.</p>

<p>But the boy tossed about restlessly on his
blanket. It was not the heat that prevented him
from sleeping, for he had become inured to
that in the Sahara.</p>

<p>It was the tormenting uncertainty as to his
father’s fate. He had felt hopeful of finding
him in the Valley of the Kings. With each
new gang of workmen discovered, his heart had
thrilled with the thought that perhaps these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
were the ones his father had employed, and
every time his hopes had been dashed to the
ground. Would he ever find him?</p>

<p>A sound came to him from without. He
propped himself up on his elbow and listened.
Again he heard it, faint but unmistakable. It
seemed to come from the direction of the
camels.</p>

<p>Silently he crept out from the shelter of the
tent and looked toward the tethered camels.</p>

<p>As his eyes accustomed themselves to the
darkness, he could make out the gaunt figures
of the beasts. Then gradually he saw something
else—the figure of a man moving about
stealthily.</p>

<p>With a shout Don rushed toward him.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br>

<small><span class="smcap">A Deadly Menace</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> figure seemed to melt away on the further
side of the camels, which had been roused
by Don’s shout and stood upright swaying
their shaggy heads. They formed a screen that
served perfectly the purpose of the marauder,
and by the time Don had circled about the animals
the man was not to be seen.</p>

<p>Don strained his eyes in every direction, but
could see nothing. The night had swallowed
up the man as though he had never been.</p>

<p>The shout had roused the other members of
the party, and they came rushing out, the captain
in the van with his rifle in his hand.</p>

<p>“What is it?” he asked, as they all crowded
around Don.</p>

<p>“There was a man here busy among the
camels,” explained Don. “I rushed at him and
he disappeared.”</p>

<p>The professor had his flashlight, and they
turned it upon the group of camels, which, they
were glad to see, were all there.</p>

<p>An exclamation came from the captain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>“Here’s what he was doing,” he cried, as
he pointed to one of the ropes that was almost
cut through.</p>

<p>“A thief!” ejaculated the professor.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” said Phalos, with a worried look
on his face. “But then again, it may have been
more than a case of common theft.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked Don. “Do you
think,” he went on, as a thought struck him,
“that Tezra and Nepahak had a hand in this?”</p>

<p>Phalos nodded assent.</p>

<p>“That is what I fear; though of course I do
not know,” he said. “The design may have
been to cripple the expedition and make it
move more slowly by the theft of one or more
of the camels. That would make it easier for
them to keep us in sight.”</p>

<p>“But if they keep us in sight, that will mean
that we will also have sight of them,” remarked
Don.</p>

<p>“I do not mean literally ‘in sight,’” explained
Phalos. “But they can keep on our
trail while staying just beyond reach of our
vision. I have a presentiment that they are
following us. They are men who will stop at
nothing.”</p>

<p>“We should have set a guard,” said the captain.
“We will after this. I’ll take my turn
to-night. And if any of those fellows try the
same trick again,” he added, as he handled his
rifle significantly, “it will go hard with them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>He took his position at the door of his tent,
and the rest resumed their attempts at slumber,
although there was little sleep for the remainder
of the night.</p>

<p>Nothing further developed, and they roused
at dawn, made a hasty breakfast and started
on.</p>

<p>“I have been thinking,” said Phalos, “that
it would be well to use a little strategy to throw
possible pursuers off our track. They probably
think that we are going to the water
hole of El Ira, since we are headed in that direction.
But Abdul, I find, knows of another
water hole off to the right that will require
quite a wide circle to reach it. I would suggest
that we take that route, and after replenishing
our water supplies, strike out for
the place where I believe we will find the Tombs
of Gold. I think that plan may balk our
enemies.”</p>

<p>This was decided on, and the party moved
ahead under Abdul’s direction, turning many a
look behind as they rode with a view to detecting
possible pursuers.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the camel on which Don was riding
stopped with a jerk that nearly unseated the
boy. Teddy was riding beside him and his
mount stopped at the same moment with similar
suddenness.</p>

<p>“What on earth’s the matter with him?” exclaimed
Don, as he urged the camel forward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>But the beasts refused to move a step, and
now Don discovered that the animal was trembling.</p>

<p>He looked about to see the reason. Suddenly,
he discovered in the sand a few feet
ahead a horrid swaying head with what seemed
to be horns and a pair of fierce, wicked eyes
that glowed like fire.</p>

<p>At first he could see no body. The creature
seemed to be all head. But as Don looked more
closely, he could see a shape of light brownish
color with yellow spots, partly hidden in the
sand. The eyes were glowing like those of a
basilisk, and the body began to coil as though
for a spring.</p>

<p>Quick as thought, Don reached for his rifle,
took swift aim and fired. The bullet smashed
the head of the creature, and the sand went
up in clouds, as the body thrashed about furiously.</p>

<p>“Good shooting!” cried Teddy admiringly,
as they dismounted to examine the reptile.</p>

<p>“What’s the shooting about?” asked the
captain, as he came riding up with the rest of
the party.</p>

<p>“This,” answered Don, as he prodded the
snake with the muzzle of his rifle.</p>

<p>“A cerastes!” exclaimed the captain, who
recognized it at once. “It’s one of the deadliest
snakes in the world. If you were bitten
by that, you’d be dead in half an hour.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>“Cleopatra’s asp,” pronounced the professor.
“It was one of those with which the
Egyptian Queen committed suicide.”</p>

<p>“Ugh!” exclaimed Teddy. “It isn’t the
thing I’d choose for a bosom friend. I’m more
particular about my company.”</p>

<p>“It’s lucky your camel saw it when he did,”
remarked the professor. “The snake would
surely have bitten him as he passed. They’re
the more dangerous because they can scarcely
be detected in the sand. A great many horses
and camels are killed by them in Egypt every
year.”</p>

<p>The suggestion by Abdul that the snakes
usually traveled in pairs was sufficient to make
the travelers mount in a hurry. But the mate
of the dead snake, if it were in the vicinity,
failed to make itself seen or felt, and they went
on unmolested, though keeping a sharp lookout
on the sands ahead.</p>

<p>“I suppose, Don, a snake more or less is
nothing in your young life, after all you killed
or captured in Brazil,” remarked Teddy, with
a laugh.</p>

<p>“That’s one case where familiarity hasn’t
bred contempt,” answered Don. “It was in
Brazil that I learned to respect them, sometimes
to run from them, as in the case of the
cooanaradi.”</p>

<p>“Call it coon and let it go at that,” laughed
Teddy. “Why did it chase you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>“Because it loved me and couldn’t bear to
part with me,” answered Don dryly. “It was a
big twelve-footer and fairly soaking with
poison. The only thing I had with me was a
machete. I swung just as it overtook and
sprang for me, and by good luck sliced its head
from its body. More than once since then I’ve
dreamed that it was chasing me.”</p>

<p>They were preparing to pitch their tents for
the midday rest when a cloud of dust appeared
on the horizon ahead of them.</p>

<p>In the desert every man is an enemy until
he is found to be a friend, and the camping was
deferred, the party remaining on their camels
while they awaited the figures that soon detached
themselves from the dust and rapidly
became larger.</p>

<p>“Get your rifles ready,” commanded the
captain. “We’ll have to see who these fellows
are. They may be Bedouins out on a raid,
or they may be peaceful traders. We’ll soon
know.”</p>

<p>As the approaching party came more distinctly
into view, apprehension vanished, for
the laden camels showed that it was an ordinary
trading caravan of small size.</p>

<p>The caravan halted and all looked curiously
at the captain’s party. Phalos and the captain
rode toward them with shouted salutations
and signs of friendliness, which were returned
in the same spirit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>Phalos interrogated the leader as to whether
he had seen any man who resembled Mr.
Sturdy, describing him as a tall man with black
hair.</p>

<p>No, the leader had seen no such man. He
had, however, seen a tall man with white hair
or nearly white. He had seen him with a party
digging near a mound, some thirty miles further
on.</p>

<p>Had he talked with him?</p>

<p>No, there was something about the man’s
eyes that had made him feel queer. But he had
talked with some of the workmen. They had
told him that they were going to quit, that their
employer had told them he would soon have no
more money to pay them. Besides, they
thought that the man had been marked by
Allah. They had grown afraid. So they were
going away.</p>

<p>This was the sum of the information they got
from the leader of the caravan, and they returned
and reported to the rest of the party,
while the traders moved on.</p>

<p>It was not very definite, certainly not conclusive,
but it brought to all of them an immense
accession of hope. Don was elated beyond
measure.</p>

<p>“Of course, father’s hair was black when I
saw him last!” he exclaimed. “But what he
has been through may have changed it.”</p>

<p>“The news is certainly encouraging,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
the captain. “Though don’t build too much
upon it, Don.”</p>

<p>“It is significant to me,” remarked Phalos,
“that the locality the man indicated is very
close to that where I believe the Tombs of Gold
to be situated.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think the time has come to take
us fully into your secret?” asked the captain.
“Suppose anything happened to you! You
might be sunstruck, become disabled in some
way. In that case, our expedition will have
come to nothing.”</p>

<p>“You are right,” agreed Zeta Phalos. “You
shall know now all that I know myself,” and
during the midday rest period he went into a
careful calculation of facts and figures with the
captain and the professor, while Don and
Teddy listened with the greatest interest and
attention.</p>

<p>The boys did not grasp all the calculation,
but one outstanding thing that impressed them
was that the place would be indicated by a rock
shaped something like a pyramid, balanced
upon another rock, flat in shape but larger than
the first.</p>

<p>They journeyed hard and fast that afternoon
and till well into the evening in the direction
indicated by the leader of the caravan. And
when they camped for the night, they were
confident that, barring accidents, they would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
within striking distance of their goal before
the following night closed in on them.</p>

<p>The next day was the hottest that they had
yet encountered. The sun beat down on them
with terrific fury. They were tortured with
sunburn and by innumerable swarms of sand-flies,
the plague of Egypt.</p>

<p>They allowed themselves only a short rest
period and pushed on.</p>

<p>Before long they came to a place where a
rocky wilderness stretched away to the right
of the road they were traversing. Here, after
a consultation of his map and a discussion with
Don’s uncles, Zeta Phalos determined to leave
the camels in the care of Ismillah and Abdul
and push into the wilderness on foot. The
camels would have been of little use to them on
those rocky slopes, and in addition Phalos was
quite as well satisfied to dispense with the servants
for the last stage of the trip. He believed
them trustworthy, but preferred to have only
the Americans with him if his goal were actually
discovered.</p>

<p>A cave that offered a secure hiding place for
the servants and the camels was found, and it
was not long before the searchers had occasion
to be thankful that they had taken the precaution.</p>

<p>As they clambered up the slope, amid the
huge rocks with which it was strewn, Don’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
keen eyes detected a body of riders in the distance
coming fast toward them.</p>

<p>Instantly he communicated his discovery to
the others and they sank down behind the rocks
that shielded them from view.</p>

<p>“They’re coming fast,” muttered the captain,
“and they are coming in the direction we
came. If it’s that Tezra bunch, they’re tired
of pussyfooting.”</p>

<p>“They may think that the time has come to
attempt to capture us and make us lead them
to the place we’re seeking,” murmured Phalos.</p>

<p>As the cavalcade drew nearer it could be
seen that it comprised more than a dozen
heavily-armed riders of fierce appearance.</p>

<p>“Bedouins whom Tezra has enlisted by
promise of loot,” conjectured Phalos.</p>

<p>The captain slipped his glasses to Don, who
was lying close beside him.</p>

<p>“You know the rascals better than I do,” he
said. “See if you can recognize them.”</p>

<p>Don focused the glasses on the leaders.</p>

<p>“There they are!” he whispered excitedly.
“Tezra and Nepahak! Those two in front.”</p>

<p>“As I suspected,” muttered the captain.</p>

<p>The party swept on and was soon lost to
view.</p>

<p>“Fooled for the time being, anyway,” said
Captain Sturdy, as he rose. “Now it’s up to
us to act quickly.”</p>

<p>The Americans and Phalos worked their way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
along among the boulders, gazing eagerly in all
directions for their landmark.</p>

<p>Suddenly Don gave a shout.</p>

<p>“There it is,” he cried, pointing straight
ahead of him. “I see it. The rock!”</p>

<p>The other members of the party looked in
the direction of Don’s pointing finger.</p>

<p>There, sure enough, loomed up a curious
combination of two rocks, both of large size,
the upper one shaped something like a pyramid,
and the lower one, on which it rested, flat
and a rough square in shape.</p>

<p>Don had been in the rear of the party with
Teddy, but it was his sharp sight that marked
the goal.</p>

<p>There was a shout of jubilation from all the
members of the group, and they hastened as
fast as the difficult ground would let them in
the direction of the rock.</p>

<p>Don was behind, but was hurrying after the
others and rapidly overtaking them when suddenly
the ground seemed to give way beneath
him. He had a sensation of falling—down—down.</p>

<p>Then came a sharp shock and he knew no
more.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br>

<small><span class="smcap">In Utter Darkness</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">How</span> long it was before he returned to consciousness,
Don could not tell. It might have
been minutes or it might have been hours.</p>

<p>Slowly, very slowly, he was able to recall
what had happened to him. He had seen the
cavalcade riding past. Then he had been clambering
among the rocks. It had been a long
climb, he remembered. There were many of
the rocks and the slope had been steep. He
must have barked his shins against some of
them. They were very sore. Yes, he must
have barked his shins. Careless of him, to be
sure, but a little arnica would fix them up all
right.</p>

<p>Was there anything else? He tried to think.
Oh, yes, he had called out something. What
was it he had been shouting about? Oh, it
was the rock! Of course, it was the rock. Why
had he not thought of that before? Well,
he had thought of it now. That was something.
He felt rather proud about that rock.
He had been the first to see it. Good boy, Don.
You are not so bad!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>He lay for a moment, pleased with the recollection.</p>

<p>What else was there? He and Teddy had
started running for it. Good old Brick! They
had been running pretty fast. Why had they
not got to it then? Where was the rock? Where
was he?</p>

<p>Then suddenly the truth burst on him, and
he sat up with a start, a cold perspiration
breaking out all over his body.</p>

<p>He remembered the ground seemingly melting
under his feet, the sickening descent, the
crash.</p>

<p>He looked wildly about him, but he might as
well have been blind for all that he could see.
Even his hand was not visible, as he held it
up before his face.</p>

<p>He felt of his arms and his legs, with an
awful fear that one or more of them might
have been broken. But they were whole, as
far as he could tell, and when he tried to move
them they responded.</p>

<p>But he was torn and scratched in innumerable
places and blood was trickling from his
wounds.</p>

<p>He dragged himself up to a standing position
and propped himself against an earth wall
that he could feel but not see. But his head
swam so that he had to sit down again, for fear
he should fall.</p>

<p>It was strange, he thought, that there was no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
light in the place. If there had been a hole for
him to fall through, there should be a hole for
light to come through. But absolute blackness
met him as he turned his eyes upward.</p>

<p>He steadied himself and tried to think.
What should he do? How could his uncles find
him? What would Brick—</p>

<p>Brick! He had been right beside him. Had
he also—Could he—</p>

<p>“Brick!” he called.</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>“Brick!” he repeated.</p>

<p>There was a faint rustling, and a weak voice
answered:</p>

<p>“That you, Don?”</p>

<p>The next instant Don was making his way in
the direction of the voice. He caught an outstretched
groping hand and his own tightened
convulsively over it.</p>

<p>For a moment both were too deeply moved
to speak. Don was the first to break the silence.</p>

<p>“Are you hurt, old boy?” he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“Somewhat disfigured, but still in the ring,”
answered Teddy, with a touch of his old levity,
though his voice was far from steady. “You
see you can’t shake me. I came along with
you. I’m sore as a boil, but no bones broken,
as far as I know. How in the mischief did we
get down here?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>“How in the mischief are we going to get
out?” responded Don.</p>

<p>“I’d give a good deal to know,” complained
Teddy.</p>

<p>“Let’s feel our way around these walls and
see if they suggest anything,” said Don.</p>

<p>Still badly shaken, but with their strength
coming back and their heads momentarily
growing clearer, the two boys groped about the
walls of their prison. They discovered an almost
cylindrical passage extending upward
that seemed to be the one through which they
had made their unexpected descent.</p>

<p>“Give me a back, Brick.”</p>

<p>Teddy bent over, and Don mounted on his
back. But with hands extended to the uttermost
he could touch nothing above.</p>

<p>Climbing was out of the question, for the
walls, though of earth, were as hard and
smooth as though they had been shaped by
machinery and offered no crevices to which
hands or feet could cling.</p>

<p>“Do you know, Brick, I don’t believe we
fell through any natural opening. If we had,
there’d be some light coming from up there.
The hole wouldn’t have closed up so suddenly.”</p>

<p>“What’s your idea then?” asked Teddy
wonderingly.</p>

<p>“I think there was a hinged door there, concealed
by earth, that sprang back again when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
it dumped us here. A trap laid, perhaps, by
the old Pharaoh to catch anybody who should
come prying about his tomb.”</p>

<p>“The old gink!” exclaimed Teddy. “Who’d
ever thought he had such a sour disposition?”</p>

<p>“That would explain why the walls are so
smooth,” continued Don. “If any one wasn’t
killed by the fall he couldn’t climb up again.
Well, we’re in for it now, and we’re up against
it for fair.”</p>

<p>“They must be looking for us outside,” said
Teddy, sobered by their plight. “Suppose we
shout to them. They may hear us.”</p>

<p>It was a good suggestion, and they shouted
till their throats were so hoarse they could do
little else but whisper.</p>

<p>But there were no answers except the echoes.</p>

<p>For some time after the boys had realized
that their efforts were fruitless, they remained
without speaking. Each was busy with his own
thoughts. And they were not pleasant ones.
Their situation dawned on them in all its horrors.</p>

<p>They were trapped, shut out, perhaps forever,
from the sight of men, doomed possibly
to die amid the lingering agonies of hunger
and thirst in this subterranean enclosure, to
which greater terrors were added by the darkness.</p>

<p>Life was sweet to them. They had barely
tasted its delights, were merely standing on its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
threshold. The blood ran strongly through
their veins. Were they to be cheated of their
birthright?</p>

<p>From these gloomy meditations, Don roused
himself with a determined shake of his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Brace up, Brick,” he counseled. “We’re
worth a dozen dead men yet. Let’s see if we
can’t find some way out of this hole.”</p>

<p>They felt around the walls until they found
a passage, so narrow that it permitted them to
walk abreast only by crowding against each
other.</p>

<p>“Let’s go,” said Don. “Whatever it leads
to can’t be any worse than this.”</p>

<p>They had gone along for perhaps a hundred
feet when suddenly their feet slipped out from
under them and they sat down with a thud on a
pavement as smooth as glass and shot down
a steep slope as swiftly as though they were on
a toboggan!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br>

<small><span class="smcap">A Frightful Apparition</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Startled</span>, confused, bewildered beyond
measure, Don and Teddy were whirled down
the steep incline at a dizzy speed, until at last
they were thrown out on the stone floor at its
foot in a medley of tossing arms and legs.</p>

<p>But the one predominant feeling in their
minds as they scrambled to their feet and
looked at each other, in a consternation that
would have been ludicrous under any other circumstances,
was that now they could really see
each other!</p>

<p>They were in the light, the blessed light;
not brilliant, but mellowed and full of shadows.
There was no visible source to which it could
be traced, but it was light, and as they looked
into each other’s eyes half the horror of their
situation seemed to have vanished. It brought
to each a reinforcement of hope and courage.</p>

<p>“Gee!” exclaimed Teddy, as he shook himself.
“Talk about shooting the chutes! That
has the big one at Coney Island beaten to a
frazzle.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>“It sure does,” agreed Don, as he looked at
the slope down which they had sped and marveled
at its mirrorlike smoothness.</p>

<p>The boys looked about them to see what kind
of a place it was into which they had been so
abruptly ushered. They found themselves in
a great spacious room, from which a series of
doorways at intervals led into smaller ones.
The roof was high and slightly arched. On the
walls was an almost endless series of paintings
that represented almost every possible scene
and custom of ancient Egyptian life.</p>

<p>They recognized at once the similarity to the
paintings they had seen on their first memorable
visit to the tombs of Tut-ankh-Amen
and the other monarchs in the Valley of the
Kings.</p>

<p>“This must be a tomb,” said Don. “Or perhaps
one of the antechambers to a tomb. But
it’s on a vastly bigger scale than anything
we’ve ever seen before.”</p>

<p>“I should say it was!” agreed Teddy, as his
eyes took in its proportions. “The others are
only also-rans as compared with this. The fellow
this was built for must have been some big
bug in his day.”</p>

<p>The lads wandered about the room, studying
with interest the scenes depicted on the walls.
They had all the stiffness that marks the work
of the Egyptian artists, but apart from that,
were surprisingly good and accurate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>“I’ve always thought the Egyptians were
sad fellows,” remarked Teddy. “But if these
paintings tell the truth, they were pretty gay
old boys if you ask me.”</p>

<p>There were pictures of royal banquets with
wine and flowers in profusion, minstrels playing,
men and women dancing, and buffoons and
clowns adding their part to the merriment.
One dancer was bearing the body of another
on his head as he whirled about. Everything
in these pictures indicated abandonment to the
material pleasures of life.</p>

<p>But there were more stately scenes, troops
of soldiers marching through the streets
crowded with spectators on both sides, solemn
religious ceremonies in the temples with the
priests in full regalia. Other pictures represented
hunting scenes, fights with lions, chariot
races, wrestling, and various athletic sports.</p>

<p>Still others, more in keeping with a mortuary
chamber, showed the progress of the soul after
it had left the body and embarked on its stormy
voyage amid the perils of the underworld and
beset by demons that sought to check its progress
before it could reach the presence of
Osiris and the realms of bliss.</p>

<p>“Look at these cartoons!” exclaimed Teddy,
as he came to lighter specimens of the painter’s
art. “I’ve seen worse in some of the evening
papers.”</p>

<p>He pointed to a hippopotamus seated among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
the leaves of a tree at a table while a crow was
climbing a ladder to wait on him. A cat, walking
on its hind legs, drove a flock of geese,
while a wolf, carrying a staff and knapsack,
led a herd of goats. A battle between mice and
cats was shown, with the king of the mice, in
a chariot drawn by two dogs, attacking the
fortress of the cats.</p>

<p>“The fellow that drew those was throwing
himself away,” declared Teddy. “He could
have got a good salary in New York.”</p>

<p>But while these novel things served a good
purpose for a time in diverting the boys’ minds
from their troubles, the latter soon returned
with redoubled force, especially when the lads
saw that the light was waning. They dreaded
the coming of the dark in those surroundings.</p>

<p>“It’s a good thing in one way, though,” said
Don, in answer to Teddy’s comment on the
growing shadows. “It shows that it’s natural
light. It must come in from somewhere; and
that somewhere must lead to the outside world.
We’ll see if we can’t find out where that is
when morning comes.”</p>

<p>They sat down touching each other, for the
comfort of companionship, and took stock of
their store of provisions. The result was anything
but satisfactory.</p>

<p>Don had a few crackers in his pocket and a
couple of cakes of chocolate. Besides these,
his canteen was two-thirds full of water. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
sum total of Teddy’s possessions was comprised
in a sandwich and a couple of seed cakes
that Ismillah had given him. And his canteen
was less than half full.</p>

<p>“Gee!” groaned Teddy, “if we only had
some of those ducks and haunches of venison
that Tut-ankh-Amen never touched! I
wouldn’t do a thing to them!”</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose they’d be much good after
three thousand years,” remarked Don, with a
lugubrious smile. “Still, if there were any
here and I were starving, I’d take a hack at
them. We’ll look around to-morrow morning
and see if we can find any.”</p>

<p>The shadows gradually deepened until they
were in blackness so deep it could be felt. In
those sepulchral surroundings, the situation
was enough to daunt the stoutest heart.</p>

<p>Suddenly a blood-curdling shriek rang
through the vaulted chamber.</p>

<p>The boys sprang to their feet in horror.</p>

<p>Again the shriek rang out, dying away in
groans and moanings. Then their eyes almost
burst from their head as they saw a great
white-sheeted figure, revealed in an unearthly
light. It seemed to advance upon them, waving
its arms menacingly!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first impulse of the boys was to flee.
But their limbs refused to obey them. They
were as though paralyzed, rooted to the spot.
Their hearts seemed to stop beating and their
blood turn to ice.</p>

<p>Then, when it seemed to be almost upon
them, the dreadful figure faded away as suddenly
as it had appeared and they were again
shrouded in darkness.</p>

<p>They were shaking as if with an ague, and
neither felt ashamed of it. Coming on top of
what they had already endured that day, the
shock was almost beyond bearing.</p>

<p>They fell rather than sat down on the stone
floor, their hands closely interlocked.</p>

<p>“Oh, Don, what was it?” quavered Teddy.
“A ghost?”</p>

<p>“Ghost, nothing!” declared Don, trying to
infuse stoutness into his denial. “You know
as well as I do that there’s no such thing as a
ghost.”</p>

<p>“I never did believe it till now,” said Teddy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
“But what was that, if it wasn’t a ghost? Lots
of people believe in them. Perhaps it’s the old
king this tomb belongs to, and he’s come to
warn us against coming here.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” replied Don.</p>

<p>“What was it then if it wasn’t a ghost?”
challenged Don’s companion.</p>

<p>“How do I know?” countered Don, who by
this time was getting back some of his usual
self-possession. “It may have been some
crazy person. Heaven knows, it’s enough to
make any one crazy to be in here. It may have
been a trick of some kind. Perhaps this is a
robbers’ cave, and that’s a way they have to
scare out intruders. I don’t know what it was,
but I’m dead sure that it isn’t a ghost. And
you know it isn’t, either.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it isn’t,” admitted Teddy, as
common sense once more took the helm. “But
it sure had me going for a minute.”</p>

<p>“Me, too,” confessed Don. “I never had
such a scare thrown into me in my life.”</p>

<p>“If only it doesn’t come back!” sighed
Teddy.</p>

<p>“If I had my rifle with’ me, I’d put a bullet
in it,” declared Don, bitterly regretting the absence
of his weapon, which had flown from his
hand when he fell.</p>

<p>“One thing is certain, that I won’t get a
wink of sleep to-night,” affirmed Teddy, staring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
fearfully through the dark in the direction
from which the ghostly visitor had come.</p>

<p>“I guess I’m with you there,” replied Don.</p>

<p>But nature was stronger than all their beliefs
and resolutions, and before long they
were sleeping the sleep of absolute exhaustion,
from which they did not wake until a pale suffusion
of light through the cavern told them it
was morning.</p>

<p>The light, faint as it was, brought them new
courage. And if they ever needed courage, it
was then.</p>

<p>They were ravenously hungry, but they took
only a nibble at their scanty store, far more
precious to them at the moment than its weight
in gold. They washed it down with a mere
swallow of water, and then set about discovering
a way of escape from what was now their
prison, but threatened to become their tomb.</p>

<p>“Do you know, Brick,” said Don thoughtfully,
“I’ve changed my opinion about that
place we fell down? I don’t believe it was a
trap.”</p>

<p>“What was it then?” asked Teddy.</p>

<p>“I think it was an entrance for those who
were supposed to have a right to come here,”
replied Don. “In the first place, if they’d
wanted to kill intruders, they’d probably have
made a better job of it—put a few spikes at the
bottom for them to be caught on, or some playful
thing like that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>“Don’t!” urged Brick, with a shudder.</p>

<p>“You see it didn’t kill us,” pursued Don.</p>

<p>“Born to be hung, perhaps,” conjectured
Teddy.</p>

<p>“And then too they wouldn’t have left that
passage open to the tomb,” continued Don.
“They’d have walled that hole all the way
around. But they didn’t. They left it open
for their own purposes.”</p>

<p>“Well, suppose they did, what does all this
lead to?”</p>

<p>“Just this,” replied Don. “That those who
came in that way didn’t expect to go back that
way. No one could climb up that toboggan.
It’s too steep and it’s too slippery, and there’s
absolutely nothing to hold on to. You might
as well try to climb up a looking glass.</p>

<p>“Now if they didn’t expect to go back that
way, they must have meant to get out some
other way. Get me?”</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Teddy, as a light broke in
on him. “You mean there’s some other entrance
to this place?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Don. “Though in our case,
as it was in theirs, it will be an exit. There
must be some such place, and it’s up to us to
find it.”</p>

<p>The boys drew new hope from the conclusion
and set out at once to look for their one
hope of safety. They tried to find the source
from which the light filtered in, thinking, naturally,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
that this would be the key to the
enigma.</p>

<p>But search as they would, the secret evaded
them. The marvelously cunning architects
and engineers of ancient times had done their
work well, if their intention was to confuse
and bewilder any unwarranted visitor.</p>

<p>Another proof of ingenuity soon warned
them of the necessity of keeping together.
They found that the many rooms that surrounded
the central hall were arranged on the
principle of a maze or labyrinth, with so many
and such unexpected openings, one into the
other, that it was almost impossible to meet at
any agreed spot. And there were so many of
these rooms and passages that the vast underground
construction suggested the Catacombs
of Rome.</p>

<p>In the middle of the day they took another
morsel of food and a swallow of water. Soon
even this would be denied them. Again they
set out on their desperate quest, tightening
their belts to still the gnawings of hunger.
Their tongues became swollen and their lips
cracked from the thirst that tortured them.</p>

<p>The coming of the night found them again
at their rendezvous in the central hall, baffled
and defeated, no nearer the solution of their
terrible problem than when they had started
in the morning.</p>

<p>A tiny morsel of food and a sip of water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
were all they dared allow themselves. Then,
haggard and hollow-eyed, they crouched as
near as they could get to each other and—waited.</p>

<p>For what?</p>

<p>The same unspoken thought was in the mind
of each.</p>

<p>Would that terrible figure appear again?</p>

<small><span class="smcap">Trapped</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Don had raised his shout of discovery
Captain Sturdy, Professor Bruce and Phalos
had rushed in the direction of the rock that
reared itself near the top of the rugged slope.</p>

<p>At times it was obscured by other boulders,
and they had difficulty in getting their bearings,
but they kept steadily getting nearer, and
at last they stood before it.</p>

<p>With a trembling hand Zeta Phalos drew
from his pocket the precious copy of the inscription.
He and the professor bent over it,
eagerly comparing point to point the indications
on it, while the captain waited impatiently.</p>

<p>At last the two straightened up with delight
in their eyes.</p>

<p>“No doubt about it!” exclaimed the professor.
“It answers every requirement. Now to
find a way in.”</p>

<p>A feverish search was made, and finally a
crevice was discovered into which a man might
worm himself behind the towering rock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>The captain turned about and shouted:</p>

<p>“Come along, Don! Come along, Teddy!”</p>

<p>He thought he heard them respond, although
it was only an echo. Then, dropping on hands
and knees, he worked his way through the
opening.</p>

<p>The others, who were smaller and slenderer,
followed the captain’s example, and all three
were presently on the other side of the rock
and in a narrow passage.</p>

<p>They straightened up and brushed off their
clothes, expecting every instant to see the boys
following them.</p>

<p>But no other form darkened the opening, and
the captain grew impatient.</p>

<p>“Hurry up, boys!” he shouted.</p>

<p>The words had scarcely left his lips when
there was a tremendous crash, and the delicately
balanced upper rock came down, filling
the entire opening and leaving them in utter
darkness.</p>

<p>The roar was deafening in that confined
space, and beat upon their eardrums until it
seemed as though they would burst. And a
cloud of dust arose that was suffocating.</p>

<p>The captain, inured to dangers and to quick
thinking, was the first to realize what had happened.</p>

<p>“Trapped!” he roared. “Trapped! Penned
in like so many rats!”</p>

<p>He rushed against the heavy stone and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
heaved against it with all the strength of his
powerful shoulders. But strain as he would,
he could not make it budge. And as he remembered
its giant size, he realized that it
must weigh scores of tons. He might as well
have tried to move a mountain.</p>

<p>As this conviction came to him, he desisted
from his efforts and came slowly towards his
companions.</p>

<p>“Lucky that the boys are not in here with
us,” he remarked, his habitual calmness returning
to him. “They, at least, have their
chance. It is singular, too,” he mused. “Don,
especially, is usually right up to the front at a
time like this. Didn’t you think they were following
us?”</p>

<p>“I thought I heard them answer you when
you called to them,” replied the professor.
“But, after all, that may have been only the
echo of your voice.”</p>

<p>“Possibly,” rejoined the captain. “But, at
any rate, they must be right outside now. We
must communicate with them and get them to
go to Ismillah and Abdul for help. With our
united efforts, we may be able to make an
exit.”</p>

<p>He approached the rock, called out as loudly
as he could and hammered on the rock with the
butt of his rifle. But no response came, and, at
last, sorely puzzled, he abandoned the attempt.</p>

<p>“Well,” Professor Bruce said grimly, “the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
old Pharaoh has sprung the trap. His dead
hand has reached out through forty centuries
and tricked us.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked the captain.</p>

<p>“What I say,” was the reply. “You don’t
suppose that it was mere accident that caused
that stone to fall just at this minute, do you?”</p>

<p>“The long arm of coincidence—”</p>

<p>“Nothing of the kind,” interrupted the professor.
“That rock was balanced so perfectly
that it would fall when a hidden spring was
pressed. And we pressed that spring when we
stepped on one of the blocks in this paved passage.
Those old fellows were marvels when it
came to bits of infernal ingenuity like that.”</p>

<p>“It is probable,” observed Phalos.</p>

<p>“The very fact that there was an opening
there should have warned us,” admitted the
captain. “Why should entrance have been so
easy? Simply to lure us in, so that we could
be punished for our presumption. ‘Will you
walk into my parlor, said the spider to the fly.’
Well, we’ve walked in all right, and if the
spider knows anything where he is, I’ll bet he
is grinning at us this moment.”</p>

<p>He communed with himself a moment in bitter
self-reproach, while Phalos and Professor
Bruce, both silently, tried to work out some
plan of procedure.</p>

<p>“Well,” the captain resumed at last, with a
return of his old nonchalant manner, “there’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
no use crying over spilt milk. We’re here, and
that’s all there is about it. We’re all grown
men, and we’re all of us able to face the truth.
I believe I’m betraying no confidence,” he
added with grim humor, “when I say that
we’re in a very serious situation. But we’ve
all been in others quite as serious and emerged
with a whole skin, and perhaps history will repeat
itself.”</p>

<p>“I’m thankful, at least, that the boys are not
with us,” remarked the professor.</p>

<p>“Amen to that,” said Phalos. “To a large
extent, we at least have lived our lives. They
have theirs before them.”</p>

<p>“And there are other bits of silver linings to
our clouds,” resumed the captain. “In the
first place, we have pretty good proof that no
one else has preceded us. So if we find the
tomb at all, we’ll find it unrifled.</p>

<p>“Then, again, I had the luck to shove our
bag of provisions through the hole before I
crawled in myself,” he continued. “There are
several extra canteens of water there too, besides
those we have strapped to us. So we have
enough with care to last us for a week or so, if
we have to stay here that long.”</p>

<p>“That’s good,” observed the professor.
“And, as we can’t go back, we’d better go forward
at once.”</p>

<p>“Yes, let’s be getting along,” the captain
said, picking up the bag of provisions and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
slinging it over his shoulder, while in the other
hand he carried his rifle. “As Amos says, we
can’t go back, and so we’ll make a virtue of
necessity and go forward. That, after all, is
what we came for.”</p>

<p>They went on carefully, picking their steps
along a paved passage, so narrow that they
had to go single file.</p>

<p>The path sloped steadily downward, so that
they knew they were going into the bowels of
the earth. The air was heavy and dank, and
yet there was at times the faintest perceptible
stirring of the air that showed there must be
some communication with the outer world. The
reflection gave them new courage, and they
quickened their steps, the captain using his
flashlight as a guide.</p>

<p>After they had gone perhaps a quarter of a
mile and were beginning to wonder whether
the passage was interminable, they suddenly
came into a large room walled in on all sides
with stone, on which were painted scenes of
Egyptian life.</p>

<p>The captain flashed his light around the
room and a cry of consternation came from the
lips of all.</p>

<p>The scene revealed was one of the wildest
confusion. Lids had been torn from coffins
and lay splintered upon the floor. Mummy
wrappings were tossed here and there, helter
skelter. On the floor over in one corner, lay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
a mummy, with the head torn from the shoulders
and lying several feet away from the
body.</p>

<p>The old Egyptian threw up his hands.</p>

<p>“Too late! Too late!” he moaned, and tore
his hair. “The tomb has been rifled!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br>

<small><span class="smcap">A Night of Horror</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Zeta Phalos’</span> companions fully shared his
feelings, though they repressed them more
than their emotional Oriental comrade.</p>

<p>“All for nothing! All for nothing!” moaned
Phalos. “After all these years and all this
effort, to find the tomb of Ras-Ameses too
late!”</p>

<p>A sense of futility and depression, too great
for words, gripped the hearts of all the men.</p>

<p>But from this first despondency a thought
came to the professor that made him start up
with renewed animation.</p>

<p>“Let me have that flashlight, will you,
Frank, for a minute?” he asked.</p>

<p>The captain relinquished it, and the professor
picked up a piece of the broken coffin lid
and examined it with care. Then he gathered
up the other pieces and laid them together as
they had been originally.</p>

<p>A moment of critical study and he straightened
up with a laugh. His companions looked
at him with amazement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>“Glad you can see something to laugh
about,” said the captain grimly.</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t I laugh?” was the reply.
“Here we’ve had all our grief for nothing.
This isn’t the coffin and that isn’t the mummy
of Ras-Ameses.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure?” asked the captain, while
Phalos ceased his moaning and hurried to his
side.</p>

<p>“Certain!” was the reply. “Look at the
symbols on this cover. Do you see the vulture?
Do you see the sacred cobra? Do you see the
crowns of Upper and Lower Egypt? Of course
you don’t. None of them is there. Yet they
would be there if this were the coffin of the
royal Ras-Ameses. This is the coffin of one of
his relatives—see, here is his name, Horum-Aleb.
Perhaps a nephew or a son-in-law.”</p>

<p>A cry of vast relief broke from the lips of
Phalos when he perceived that the professor
was right in his conclusions.</p>

<p>“You are right,” he said. “I jumped too
soon at conclusions. I should have remembered
that large numbers of the royal family
were buried in close proximity to the Pharaoh
himself.”</p>

<p>His relief, however, though great, was not
of long duration, and his brow clouded as another
thought occurred to him.</p>

<p>“But if men have broken in here and despoiled
this tomb, is it likely that they would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
stop here?” he asked. “Would they not persist
until they found the vastly more valuable
one of the king himself?”</p>

<p>“That, of course, is possible,” conceded the
professor. “But we’ll not assume that until
we know it. Besides, everything here shows
that they acted with the wildest haste. They
may have been alarmed and made off with their
booty without going any farther.”</p>

<p>“There’s one other angle to this matter,”
put in the captain. “Whoever rifled this tomb
had some other way of getting into it and getting
out of it than by the way we came in. We
know that they didn’t use that, or the stone
would have been down when we got to it. And
if there is another entrance or exit, we have
our chance of finding it.”</p>

<p>“Is there anything in the inscription bearing
on this tomb of Horum-Aleb?” asked the
professor.</p>

<p>“Not by name,” replied Phalos. “I have
pored over the manuscript so often that I know
it by heart, and that name does not occur in it.
But the diagram that I have worked out from
the veiled descriptions of the whole group of
tombs gives an estimate of their length and
width that may be of help to us in this instance.”</p>

<p>“Will you lend us your flashlight again,
Frank, while we look it up?” asked the professor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>Somewhat to his surprise, the captain hesitated.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to be exceedingly careful of this
flashlight,” he observed. “I have only one
extra battery with me, and if we have to stay
here long our lives may depend upon our having
light enough to see our way about. But I
have plenty of matches, and we’ll use torches
and small fires as far as possible.”</p>

<p>“You always think of everything, Frank,”
was the tribute the professor paid him. “Very
well, then, we’ll use one of these splintered
pieces of coffin lid as a torch.”</p>

<p>He lighted one end of the resinous wood,
which burned with a bright though flickering
light.</p>

<p>“While we’re looking this over, Frank,” the
professor suggested, “suppose you take the
measurements of this room with your tape.”</p>

<p>The captain complied, and found that the
mortuary chamber was thirty-three feet long
by twenty-two wide.</p>

<p>He announced the result, and an expression
of gratification came from the lips of the
savants.</p>

<p>“Those figures apply to a tomb only the
third removed from that of Ras-Ameses, as
far as we can make out,” said Phalos. “We
can’t be very far from the royal tomb itself.”</p>

<p>“Do you remember, Frank,” asked the professor,
“how many such measurements were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
found in the memoranda of Richard’s that we
examined at Hillville? That shows that he
wasn’t following a blind trail, but had something
definite to go upon. It’s another proof
that it was he who secured the other copy of
the inscription.”</p>

<p>“I guess you’re right,” agreed the captain.</p>

<p>They went forward, and found themselves
before long in a bewildering maze of passages
that branched off from one another in all directions.
Some led up to walls that might or
might not have rooms on the other side. Others
terminated in what were veritable points, and
had evidently been designed to mislead and
weary any intruder into the tombs.</p>

<p>“You have to hand it to those old engineers
and architects,” grumbled the captain, in unwilling
admiration. “In cunning and foxiness
they’d make some of our modern ones look like
thirty cents.”</p>

<p>The demands of hunger now began to make
themselves felt, and the professor suggested
that they snatch a hasty meal. The others
willingly acquiesced.</p>

<p>“Napoleon used to say that an army, like a
snake, traveled on its stomach,” remarked the
professor. “Which is one way of saying that
a hungry man is no good for fighting. And we
have a fight on our hands, if any one ever
had.”</p>

<p>They made their way back to the mortuary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
chamber of Horum-Aleb. Once there, they
took from the bag of provisions a limited
amount of their precious stores. They ate
sparingly, but the meal was made more palatable
by coffee that Ismillah had brewed that
morning and placed in a thermos bottle.</p>

<p>Never before had any of them partaken of a
meal in such weird and uncanny surroundings.
To save the light, they sat in utter darkness.
This had the additional advantage of hiding
from them the funereal trappings and the
dried-up figure of the headless mummy lying
over in the corner.</p>

<p>But they knew it was there. That thing that
had once been a man like themselves was there.
They could visualize him in the darkness. He
was a guest at their meal—a very quiet guest
to be sure—but he was there.</p>

<p>Suddenly there rose a wail as of a soul in
torment, a dreadful hideous shriek that filled
them with horror.</p>

<p>The old Egyptian fell over on his face and
groveled on the floor.</p>

<p>“The vengeance of the ancient gods,” he
cried wildly, “for daring to search for the
Tombs of Gold!”</p>

<small><span class="smcap">The Man by the Stream</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Crouching</span> down in the central hall, baffled
and defeated in their efforts to find a way out
into the world beyond the great cave, Don and
Teddy sat for a long time in an attitude of
strained expectation. No word was spoken, but
each knew what the other was waiting for.
They were hungry and thirsty, but if that had
been all they would have resigned themselves
and tried to forget their misery in sleep.</p>

<p>But there was more than that—the dread of
the supernatural!</p>

<p>Very frequently the bravest of men does not
care to go through a cemetery at night. He
may laugh and make light of his fears. He may
summon his common sense to his aid. He
may tell himself that only fools fear the dead.
Yet, however he may fortify himself, some obscure
survival of the fear inherited from generations
of superstitious ancestors makes him
heartily glad when he leaves the dead behind
and finds himself once more in the haunts of
the living.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>Teddy at last broke the silence.</p>

<p>“Do you think it will come to-night?” he
asked, looking around him fearfully, as though
his eyes could pierce the darkness.</p>

<p>“I guess not, Brick,” answered Don encouragingly.
“I don’t think—”</p>

<p>Just then it came!</p>

<p>Again a weird, blood-chilling shriek rang
down the passage, repeating itself in a thousand
echoes, and again before the terrified gaze
of the boys that frightful figure upreared itself
and seemed to advance toward them with
waving arms and threatening gestures.</p>

<p>Another long-drawn shriek and the apparition
disappeared, seeming to melt at once into
nothingness.</p>

<p>The boys clung close together, their hearts
beating like triphammers, their minds dazed.
Only gradually did they relax, and for a long
time they trembled like leaves.</p>

<p>“I—I tell you it <i>is</i> a ghost,” said Teddy, at
last, tried beyond endurance.</p>

<p>“And I tell you it isn’t,” retorted Don, who,
however, was shaken almost as much as his
comrade.</p>

<p>“It is, it is!” reiterated Teddy, covering his
face with his hands, as though thus he could
shut out the memory of the hideous apparition.</p>

<p>“Oh, if I only had my rifle,” groaned Don, to
whom the mere feel of that trusty weapon
would have brought strength and comfort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>“It wouldn’t have done you any good if you
had had it,” replied Teddy. “You’d have to
have a silver bullet in it to kill a ghost.”</p>

<p>Don could not help laughing, and it was
amazing how that laugh helped to break the
tension.</p>

<p>“Well, you do,” repeated Teddy defensively.
“And it has to be blessed by a bishop, too.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t any silver bullet handy or a
bishop either,” said Don. “Anyway, lead and
steel are good enough for me.</p>

<p>“Now look here, Brick,” he went on.
“We’ve got to pull ourselves together and put
all that nonsense about ghosts out of mind. We
know when we think it over that there isn’t any
such thing.”</p>

<p>“But we’ve got to believe our eyes,” insisted
Teddy. “We saw it, didn’t we?”</p>

<p>“We saw something. But what it was, we
don’t know. But I’m going to try to find out,”
and Don rose to his feet with an air of decision.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” asked Teddy.</p>

<p>“Down that passage,” answered Don, pointing
in the direction of the apparition.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t!” urged Teddy, laying his hand
on his arm.</p>

<p>“I’m going,” reiterated Don. “Come
along.”</p>

<p>Teddy had the alternative of accompanying
his comrade or staying behind, and he chose
the former. He had never yet deserted Don<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
in a crisis, and he was not going to do it now.</p>

<p>The boys advanced slowly in the pitch darkness,
feeling their way inch by inch. And that
caution was justified when Don, putting out his
foot tentatively, felt nothing beneath it and
hurriedly drew back.</p>

<p>“Back, Teddy!” he warned. “There’s a
break here.”</p>

<p>He knelt down and reached his hand over
into the opening as far down as he could, without
coming in contact with anything.</p>

<p>“I wonder how deep it is,” he pondered.
“Oh, if we only had a light of some kind.”</p>

<p>He took a bunch of keys from his pocket and
found an old one belonging to the house at Hillville
which he could dispense with.</p>

<p>“I’ll throw this in,” he said, “and we can
tell from the sound when it strikes how deep
the hole is.”</p>

<p>He dropped the key and they listened. The
seconds passed. Then far, far down, they
heard a faint tinkling, as the key struck a rock.</p>

<p>They recoiled from the brink in consternation.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s almost bottomless!” exclaimed
Teddy. “It must be hundreds and hundreds of
feet deep!”</p>

<p>“Right you are, Brick,” agreed Don soberly.
“If we’d fallen in there, there wouldn’t have
been anything left but a grease spot. We can’t
go any further, and we might as well go back.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>“That must be where the g—the creature
lives,” observed Teddy, as they again reached
the large room.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you didn’t say ‘ghost’ that time,”
laughed Don. “Yes, that’s the spot it seemed
to come from.”</p>

<p>The mere fact that they had tried to “take
the bull by the horns,” as Teddy put it, was in
itself a bracing element, and they had less
trouble in getting to sleep than they had had
the night before.</p>

<p>But the morning brought with it the grim
fact that they were face to face with actual
starvation. Their last morsel of food and last
drop of water, miserably insufficient as they
were, disappeared. They were suffering intensely,
and each was shocked as he looked at
the sunken cheeks and hollow eyes of the other.</p>

<p>Their thirst, especially, was overpowering.
The tightening of their belts helped in some
degree to make them forget their hunger, but
no such resource could abate their thirst.</p>

<p>They were tormented with visions of sparkling
springs and flowing rivers. Their thoughts
went back to that night on the balcony of
Phalos’s villa when they heard the tinkling of
the fountains in the courtyard and watched the
ripples on the surface of the Nile. There, was
water in plenty. What would they not have
given now for a single drop to moisten their
cracked lips and swollen tongues!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>“We’ve just got to find our way out to-day,
old boy,” said Don in desperation. “Another
day or two and we’ll be too weak to do anything
but lie here and die.”</p>

<p>They started out, summoning all their energy
and examining every room and every passage
that seemed to offer the slightest chance of an
exit. But the morning dragged away without
result, and with every hour they grew more
feverish and weak.</p>

<p>About noon, as nearly as they could guess
from the light, Don’s eyes lighted on a stone
that seemed to have fallen slightly away from
its fellows in the corner of a passage. He
grasped it, and it gave slightly under his hand.</p>

<p>He shouted to Teddy, and together they
pulled and hauled sufficiently to make an opening
through which they could pull themselves.
They were panting and exhausted when they
drew themselves up and looked about them.</p>

<p>They found themselves in what seemed to
have been a receiving vault of the long ago.
There were three broad shelves, on which were
resting sarcophagi that seemed to have been
placed there temporarily, awaiting perhaps a
more ceremonious burial later.</p>

<p>Don gave a shout, as his eyes rested on them.</p>

<p>“Gold!” he exclaimed, looking from the lids
of the coffins to the slender pillars that adorned
the structure. “Gold! Look at them, Brick!
As bright and untarnished as the day they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
placed here. Brick, old boy, we’ve come across
a treasure!”</p>

<p>For a time the lads were filled with a wild
elation, and they moved rapidly from one object
to another, handling, examining, tracing
the curious inscriptions.</p>

<p>Then the stark reality of their situation came
back to them. What good was their wonderful
discovery, after all? What could it do for
them?</p>

<p>Here they had happened on wealth that
would buy them the most sumptuous banquets
that the world could provide. It gave them
everything—and nothing.</p>

<p>“Starving to death with all this gold about
us!” muttered Teddy bitterly. “I’d give it all
for a cup of water.”</p>

<p>“The poorest beggar with his crust on the
steps of a mosque is better off than we are,”
agreed Don moodily.</p>

<p>He bowed his head in his hands. Then suddenly
he raised it again. What was that he
heard?</p>

<p>He listened intently, and hope shot into his
eyes. But he had heard of the fancies of the
victims of thirst and he was afraid. Was he
growing delirious?</p>

<p>“Brick,” he said huskily to his friend, who
sat hunched up in a corner. “Listen, and tell
me if you hear anything.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>Inspired by the new tone in Don’s voice,
Brick sat up.</p>

<p>“It—it sounds like falling water!” he exclaimed,
in an awed voice. “Oh, Don, are we
going crazy?”</p>

<p>“Come,” cried Don, staggering with weakness,
but hurrying as fast as he could in the
direction of the sound.</p>

<p>At a sudden turn in a passage the sound
grew louder, and an instant later their eyes
fell on a small stream of water, dashing over
a rocky bed.</p>

<p>With a wild cry of delight, the boys threw
themselves on the brink of the stream and
plunged their heads into the cooling water.
Then they drank avidly until Don, remembering
caution, pulled Teddy back with main
force.</p>

<p>“Easy, old boy,” he laughed happily. “Take
your time. You’ll get into trouble if you
drink too much after being without it so long.
The stream isn’t going to run away.”</p>

<p>The soundness of this appealed to Teddy,
and he refrained for a time. But again and
again they plunged their heads into the water,
each time feeling new life thrill through every
vein.</p>

<p>At last Don sprang up and threw off his
coat.</p>

<p>“I’m going in all over,” he cried. “And,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
oh, what a bath this is going to be! Come
along, Brick, and see who’ll be in—”</p>

<p>He stopped as though transfixed.</p>

<p>On the other side of the stream sat a man,
looking at him curiously.</p>

<p>A wild cry burst from Don’s lips.</p>

<p>“Father!” he cried. “Father!”</p>

<small><span class="smcap">A Joyful Reunion</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Don</span> plunged into the stream, which was only
a couple of feet deep, and waded over to the
other side, uttering incoherent exclamations of
wonder and delight.</p>

<p>The man watched his coming with a dawning
look of recognition in his eyes. He brushed
his hand over his face, as though to clear his
mind of some bewilderment. He was standing
when Don got to him.</p>

<p>Don threw his arms about him and hugged
him convulsively.</p>

<p>“Father! Father!” he reiterated again and
again, holding the man tightly as though he
feared he would vanish. “I’ve found you at
last! Oh, I’ve found you at last!”</p>

<p>Mr. Sturdy returned his son’s embrace, at
first in a perfunctory way. Then, suddenly, as
though the floodgates of memory had been
opened, his clasp tightened. All the hunger
of his heart, long separated from his boy, found
expression in his voice.</p>

<p>“Don, my dear boy! Don, how glad I am to
see you again!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>They remained a long time embraced, uttering
words of endearment, and then Don, his
face wet with happy tears, released his hold
and stepped back, in order that he might see
the dear face for which he had searched over a
large part of the world.</p>

<p>It was a fine face, cleanly chiseled, with
splendid forehead and dark, piercing, but
kindly, eyes. The form was like that of his
brother Frank’s, tall, sinewy and powerful.
His complexion was as bronzed as that of an
Indian from his work as an explorer under
many suns. But the black hair that Don remembered
was now heavily streaked with silver.</p>

<p>“But how comes it that you are in Brazil,
my dear boy?” asked his father. “I thought
you were at home in Hillville. I was counting
on seeing you again as soon as Mr. Clifton had
his yacht ready to sail.”</p>

<p>From the first mention of Brazil, Don had
been thinking rapidly. It was evident that the
happy shock of seeing Don had in some way
swept away the knowledge of this present
Egyptian adventure and carried his father
back again to Mr. Clifton’s plantation.</p>

<p>Don knew little of mental science, but he
knew instinctively that any revelation he might
make to his father of the real condition of
things must be made gradually and tactfully.</p>

<p>“Oh, I got impatient to see you,” he said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
with perfect truth. “And as Uncle Frank and
Uncle Amos were coming to Brazil on a hunting
expedition, I got them to bring me along.”</p>

<p>“Fine!” declared his father. “Your mother
will be as delighted as I am to see you sooner
than she expected. But perhaps you have seen
her already?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I’ve seen her,” replied Don, who
found himself getting into deep waters.</p>

<p>He looked up and saw Teddy near by, and
welcomed him as a diversion.</p>

<p>“This is my friend, Teddy Allison, Father,”
Don introduced him.</p>

<p>“Any friend of Don’s is a friend of mine,”
said Mr. Sturdy genially, as he took Teddy’s
extended hand. “What do you think of Brazil,
as far as you’ve seen it?”</p>

<p>Poor Teddy, who had never laid eyes on
Brazil, was nonplused. Don came quickly to
his relief.</p>

<p>“He thinks it’s a mighty fine country; don’t
you, Teddy?” he said brightly.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” answered Teddy, clutching
gratefully at the cue thrown to him. “A very
wonderful country.”</p>

<p>“You’ll enjoy looking over Mr. Clifton’s
plantation,” went on Mr. Sturdy. “I’ll show
you around it if you like. It’s a remarkable
place.”</p>

<p>To ease the situation, Don urged his father
to tell them about the wreck of the <i>Mercury</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
and Mr. Sturdy did so. But there were certain
breaks and pauses in the narration, as
though the story teller were trying to reconcile
certain things that bewildered him.</p>

<p>Don’s mind was in a storm of conflicting
emotions. The dominant feeling was one of
intense delight. His father at last was restored
to him. But his heart was torn with
grief at his father’s distraught condition and
with perplexity as to how, if at all, he could
bring him to a clear conception of things as
they were.</p>

<p>“Guess perhaps we’d better go in and get
dinner,” said Mr. Sturdy genially. “Are you
hungry?”</p>

<p>Don and Teddy looked at each other. Were
they hungry?</p>

<p>“Though now I think of it I have some provisions
here,” went on Mr. Sturdy, and their
hearts leaped. “The servants must have put
up a lunch for me when I came out into this
grotto, though I don’t remember bringing it.
Why they wanted to put up so much I can’t
imagine,” he continued, as he went to a little
distance and returned with a big bag of food of
various kinds. “But here it is. Help yourselves.”</p>

<p>The boys dived into the bag, and brought out
bread and meat and canned supplies, which
Don rightly conjectured were part of the equipment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
with which his father had started on this
strange expedition.</p>

<p>It was like manna from the skies, and the
poor starved boys had all they could do to refrain
from gorging it like wolves. But they
knew that in their condition this might prove
fatal, and besides they had to conserve the contents
of the bag.</p>

<p>So with a mighty effort they restrained themselves
and ate but sparingly, with new life flowing
through their veins and new hope springing
in their hearts.</p>

<p>What marvelous changes an hour had
wrought! Many problems remained yet to be
solved, but they faced them with high hearts
and renewed courage. They felt equal to any
fate.</p>

<p>While they ate, Mr. Sturdy had been watching
Don with deep affection in his eyes. But
his bewilderment persisted. Again and again
he rubbed his forehead in perplexity.</p>

<p>“Do you know,” he said, when they had finished,
“there’s something queer about this
grotto? It looks more like Egypt than Brazil.”</p>

<p>Don thought the time had come to hazard a
bold stroke.</p>

<p>“It is Egypt,” he said quietly.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI<br>

<small><span class="smcap">In the Labyrinth</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> the culture and self-restraint acquired
in years was stripped from Zeta Phalos for the
moment, even his religion dropped away, and
the superstition of his ancestors took possession
of him, as he lay moaning and beating his
head on the floor of the cave in the hope of
propitiating the angry gods of his remote
forebears who were making those weird, ghost-like
noises.</p>

<p>It would have been idle for the captain and
Professor Bruce to have denied that they were
terribly frightened. They were brave men who
had often faced death unflinchingly. But just
now cold, stark terror had a grip on their
souls.</p>

<p>Again that awful scream rang through the
vaulted halls, and this time after one mighty
paroxysm of fear, the Egyptian lay still. He
had fainted.</p>

<p>The necessity of doing something to help
him broke the spell that had fastened on his
companions, and they sprang to his relief.
They chafed his hands and wrists. After a
long time he opened his eyes, only to close them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
again with a cry, as he remembered his experience.</p>

<p>“The gods! The gods of my forebears!” he
moaned. “They would not be defied. They
are punishing us for our presumption.”</p>

<p>“Come, now! Come!” urged the captain,
not unkindly, his own self-possession having
been restored to him by the necessity of action.
“Pull yourself together. After all, a
sound doesn’t kill anybody.”</p>

<p>It was a long time, however, before the old
Egyptian regained his composure. He maintained
a listening attitude, and at intervals
kept casting uneasy glances toward the unseen
body with the severed head that lay there
so quietly, but, as he thought, so menacingly,
in the darkness.</p>

<p>The professor rightly interpreted his
thought.</p>

<p>“It won’t do any harm to remove the
mummy to some other place, Frank,” he suggested
quietly to his brother. “They used to
pass them around at Egyptian banquets to remind
the diners of the brevity of life. But to
my mind they’re not very cheerful adjuncts of
a feast.”</p>

<p>The captain agreed, and together he and Professor
Bruce took the mummy into a distant
passage and laid the poor relic of humanity
down reverently.</p>

<p>The act itself and the fearlessness with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
which his companions went about their distasteful
work helped Phalos markedly to resume
his usual philosophical attitude.</p>

<p>“Old traditions were too strong for me,” he
murmured apologetically. “Then, too, my
years are telling on me and we’ve been under
an unusual strain to-day.”</p>

<p>“I can well understand how you feel,” replied
the professor with a genial smile. “And
I don’t mind admitting that I too was unnerved.
What do you think it was, Frank?”
he asked, turning to his brother.</p>

<p>“Can’t say,” replied the captain. “Of
course, we’ll cut out right now any suggestion
of the supernatural. That yell had either a
human or a mechanical origin. It may have
been some freak due to natural causes and the
configuration of these catacombs. Or it may
have been a trick to frighten us away on the
part of some one who doesn’t dare meet us in
the open. As it stands, one guess is as good as
another.”</p>

<p>“If only it doesn’t come again!” ejaculated
Phalos fervently.</p>

<p>“Let’s hope it won’t,” returned the captain.
He smiled grimly and added: “I know
when I’ve had enough. But if it does, it won’t
be so startling as the first time, for now we’re
prepared for it. But now that we’ve had our
supper, what do you say to starting on again?”</p>

<p>All agreed to this, but when Phalos tried to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
walk he found that his trembling limbs would
hardly support him.</p>

<p>There was no help for it, and they had to
defer their attempt until the morning. They
composed themselves to sleep as best they
could, though the captain, who always slept
with one eye open, kept his rifle close at hand
so that he could clutch it instantly in case of
need.</p>

<p>Nothing occurred through the night to disturb
them, however; and as the old Egyptian
woke refreshed and much stronger, they resumed
their search after they had partaken of
a scanty meal and finished the rest of Ismillah’s
coffee.</p>

<p>They wandered about, examining every
passage that seemed to promise results, only
to have their souls made sick by hope deferred.
As far as they could, they endeavored to keep
within a small radius of the despoiled tomb,
for the diagram of Phalos had made it probable
that the royal tomb of Ras-Ameses was
somewhere in its vicinity.</p>

<p>The entire day passed without success, and
it was a disgruntled trio that, when night came,
sought once more the room in which they had
passed the night before.</p>

<p>Their provisions were dwindling, and their
forced abstinence was already compelling them
to feel the pangs of hunger and thirst.</p>

<p>“Glad the boys are not in here with us,” remarked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
the captain. “With their young
healthy appetites they’d feel this a mighty sight
worse than we do. At least they’ll have plenty
of provisions in the camp with Ismillah and
Abdul.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been worrying about them all day,”
said the professor, his brow creased with
anxiety. “There hasn’t been a moment when
they were absent from my thoughts.”</p>

<p>“Same here,” admitted the captain.
“Though both the boys are better able to take
care of themselves than any other I’ve ever
seen.”</p>

<p>That night the awful shriek came again, rising
in hideous crescendo and dying away in
moans that chilled the blood. Fear once more
laid its icy hand on their hearts, but this time
they were prepared for it and inwardly defied
it, even Phalos controlling, outwardly at least,
his terror.</p>

<p>About noon the next day an exclamation
from Professor Bruce brought the other two
hurrying to his side.</p>

<p>They found him standing before a perfectly
square stone construction measuring exactly
thirty-six feet on every side. It was of polished
granite, with the blocks fitted into each
other so perfectly that the seams were scarcely
visible.</p>

<p>With trembling fingers, the professor and
Phalos consulted the manuscript and compared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
it with the symbols that were carved on the
nearer side. A shout of triumph burst simultaneously
from their lips.</p>

<p>“Eureka!” shouted the professor. “We
have found it! The tomb of Ras-Ameses!”</p>

<p>“The greatest of the Tombs of Gold!” cried
Phalos exultantly.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br>

<small><span class="smcap">A Bewildering Experience</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Don declared that they were in Egypt,
Mr. Sturdy looked at his son as if he doubted
his sanity.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” he asked. “Are you
fooling?”</p>

<p>“Listen, Father dear,” said Don, with an
inward prayer for guidance. “You’ve been ill
for a while, very ill, and during that illness you
were brought to Egypt. Mother came with
you, so that it was all right. And before I say
anything else, let me tell you that mother and
Ruth are well and happy—that is, they will be
perfectly happy when you are with them once
again. Won’t that be great, Father, all of us
together again in the dear old home at Hillville?”</p>

<p>“But—what—but—” stammered Don’s
father, trying to assimilate the new and to
some extent terrifying ideas that came crowding
in upon him. “Do you mean to say that I
have been unconscious all this time?”</p>

<p>“Not unconscious, Father,” replied Don.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
“But—but in a kind of daze, as it were. And
when you got to Egypt you wanted to go on
with the work you had been doing before the
war—you know, excavating in the Valley of
the Kings.”</p>

<p>“The Valley of the Kings!” exclaimed Mr.
Sturdy. “Yes, I remember that I did a good
deal of work there in the old days. I was looking,
I remember, for a special tomb—that of
Ras-Ameses. Of course,” he added hurriedly,
“I want you to keep that a secret between you
and me. Don’t mention that name to anybody.
Some day I hope to go looking for it again.”</p>

<p>“You have been looking for it, Father,” said
Don gently. “While your mind was in a daze,
you know. And I believe you’ve found it. I
believe you’re in it now.”</p>

<p>There was such a look of utter bewilderment
on his father’s face that Don’s heart ached.</p>

<p>“But don’t try to get the rights of it just
now,” went on Don, rising. “There’ll be
plenty of time for that. The only thing that
counts is that I’ve got you again. Come and
look at what Teddy and I found this morning,”
he said. “Come along, Teddy,” he added.
“And suppose you bring that bag of provisions
along with you.”</p>

<p>“Will I?” returned Teddy. “Just watch
me! I’ll cling to it like the ivy to the oak.”</p>

<p>As Don, with his heart beating high, walked
along beside his father, he was delighted to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
note the springiness of step and vigor of movement
that testified to his parent’s superb physical
condition. That, he knew, would be one of
the most important factors in restoring him to
mental health.</p>

<p>There was the enthusiasm of the skilled
Egyptologist in the exclamations with which
Mr. Sturdy viewed the wonders that the boys
had discovered that morning. His delight was
unbounded, and he confirmed without question
the boys’ estimate of the wealth of their discovery.</p>

<p>But all the time the battle was going on between
the dual personality—the Sturdy of
Brazil and the Sturdy of Egypt. It was pitiful,
and yet at the same time encouraging, to
note the way that trained intelligence of his
was trying to reconcile the two and bring order
out of chaos.</p>

<p>“Now, Father,” said Don, after a while,
“suppose you come to the place where Teddy
and I have been roosting while we’ve been here,
and lie down and rest. That will give you a
chance to think this thing out and get your
bearings. Oh, how happy I am to have you
with me again!” he added, giving him an affectionate
hug.</p>

<p>Mr. Sturdy welcomed the suggestion. What
he wanted more than anything else was an uninterrupted
opportunity to think. Already he
was piecing things together, and under the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
severe stimulus his mental condition was mending.</p>

<p>All that long afternoon Don’s father lay
awake, stretched out on his back, trying to adjust
himself to actual conditions. And it was
not until the dusk was gathering that Don
called him to the simple supper that he and
Teddy had quietly prepared.</p>

<p>“I ought to tell you, Father,” said Don,
dwelling lovingly on the name that he had so
often longed to speak, “that we’ve had an unusual
and rather shivery experience each night
since we’ve been here,” and he went on to tell
of the apparition.</p>

<p>Mr. Sturdy listened with interest.</p>

<p>“I don’t wonder you were frightened,” he
said. “It was enough to terrify any one. I’m
glad you told me about it. Forewarned is forearmed.
It won’t be pleasant to see or listen to,
but it’s very different from having it take you
unawares.”</p>

<p>But even though prepared, they were all
chilled to the marrow when, an hour later, that
frightful shriek was heard and they saw the
sheeted figure advancing toward them.</p>

<p>Even as they shrank back before the menacing
monster, a shot rang out, and the apparition
wavered for a moment and disappeared.</p>

<p>The three of them sprang to their feet in
wild amazement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>“Who fired that shot?” cried Don. “Did
you, Father?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied his father. “I have no rifle.
I thought it was you.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t any either,” replied Don. “Uncle
Frank! Uncle Frank!” he shouted, in uncontrollable
excitement.</p>

<p>There was a shout of surprise from a passage
near at hand, and the next moment the
captain, with a flashlight in his hand, followed
by the professor and Phalos, came rushing up
and threw his arms about Don.</p>

<p>“My dear, dear boy!” he exclaimed, with his
voice husky with emotion.</p>

<p>“But see, Uncle Frank! Uncle Amos!”
cried Don. “Here’s father! Don’t you recognize
him? I’ve found my father!”</p>

<p>The scene that took place for the next few
minutes beggared description. There were
sounds of delight, grasps of the hand, slaps on
the back, incoherent questions tumbling over
one another. Hardly any one knew what he
was doing or saying, but all knew that they
were supremely, overwhelmingly happy.</p>

<p>“We’ve found you, Dick, old man; we’ve
found you!” jubilated the captain. “And, oh,
the luck of it! We’ve found you in the Tombs
of Gold!”</p>

<small><span class="smcap">Riches beyond Price</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a long time before the members of
the party could settle down to a narration of
their respective adventures. A torch was secured
from the débris in the room of Horum-Aleb,
and by its light they sat in a group, so
that they could see each other’s features as
they talked.</p>

<p>“How lucky it was that you decided to take
a shot at the ghost—or whatever it is,” remarked
Don. “If it hadn’t been for that, we
might never have got together.”</p>

<p>“I suppose the chief reason I shot at it, was
to relieve my feelings,” answered the captain,
with a grin. “If it were anything human, it
deserved to be shot. If it were anything mechanical,
I thought I might disable the mechanism.
We hadn’t seen the thing before to-night,
but we’d heard it, and I had judged just
about where we’d find it, and my guess was
good. I’ll take a look around in the morning.”</p>

<p>Don had snatched an opportunity to reveal
to his uncles what he had already told his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
father, and they acted with great tact and
judgment in evading risky subjects and yet including
him in their expedition, as if he knew
all about it.</p>

<p>The elders listened avidly, too, to the boys’
narration of what had happened since they had
been separated, and also to their story of the
gold objects they had found that morning.</p>

<p>“Those alone would richly repay us for our
trip,” observed the professor exultantly, while
the face of Phalos flushed with pleasure. “If
now we can add to them the things undoubtedly
in the tomb of Ras-Ameses—”</p>

<p>“Ras-Ameses!” exclaimed Don. “Do you
mean to say that you have found it?”</p>

<p>“Practically sure of it,” asserted the captain.
“That’s all the good it does us though,
for the present,” he added, his face falling.
“It’s so solidly built it would take a charge of
dynamite to blow it open.”</p>

<p>“No door or opening of any kind?” queried
Don.</p>

<p>“Nothing that we’ve been able to discover
so far,” was the reply. “But we’re going at
it again in the morning.”</p>

<p>In the jubilation in which they all shared,
they put aside for the moment the fact that
they were prisoners, doomed to perish inevitably
of hunger unless they could find an exit,
for which all had hitherto searched in vain.
But every little while that grim terror slipped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
into their thoughts, like a specter at a feast.</p>

<p>They talked until late into the night, and
they were delighted to note the rapidity with
which Don’s father was beginning to adjust
himself to conditions. Yet, every so often,
there would be moments of confusion that were
baffling and saddening.</p>

<p>The next morning after a hasty breakfast,
in which Mr. Sturdy’s stores played the
greater part, all went to the supposed mausoleum
of Ras-Ameses. They examined every
inch of it with the greatest care, but found not
the slightest clue to an entrance.</p>

<p>“Suppose you hoist me up to the top,” suggested
Don.</p>

<p>They made a back for him, and he swung
himself up. The top was flat, and made of the
same massive blocks as the sides. Nothing rewarded
his search.</p>

<p>His announcement to that effect was received
with glum silence. It removed their last hope.
They were thoroughly dispirited and disheartened.</p>

<p>As Don rested on the edge, he noticed a fretwork
running along the top, the only ornament
that relieved the severity of the tomb. He ran
his hand along the edge, slowly, carefully,
pressing in turn every projection.</p>

<p>Then a thrill ran through his veins. One of
them had yielded, ever so slightly, but it had
yielded!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>He pressed upon it with all his might. And
there, before the gazing spectators, who stood
spellbound with amazement, one of the great
blocks about four feet from the ground swung
silently inward, revealing an aperture about
three feet in width and height.</p>

<p>With an excited shout, the professor went
through the opening, followed one by one by
the others, and they found themselves in the
tomb of one of the mightiest of the Pharaohs,
on which no eyes had looked since it had been
sealed thousands of years before.</p>

<p>Untold riches dazzled their eyes, as they
looked about them. Gold, gold, gold everywhere,
in columns and tablets and coffin lids
and statues, in beds and chariots and boats and
amulets, in chairs and maces and scepters and
symbols, gold in a profusion that stunned them
and took away their breath. And besides this
immeasurable wealth, there were other things
quite as priceless, rings, robes, cups, whips,
vases, inlaid and encrusted with precious
stones. And on a great golden slab lay the
sarcophagus of the mighty monarch who once
possessed all these treasures and had ordered
them to be brought to his tomb as emblems of
his boundless wealth.</p>

<p>Hours passed like minutes while the excited
group passed from one object to another,
hardly daring to believe their good fortune,
and half fearing that they would wake and find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
it all a dream. They had expected much, but
this surpassed all their expectations.</p>

<p>It was only weariness that reminded them
that they had spent the whole day in rejoicing
over their wonderful discovery and suggested
the need of food and rest.</p>

<p>“We owe it all to you, Don,” said the professor,
as the excited and happy group made
their way back to the rendezvous. “If you
hadn’t found that spring—”</p>

<p>“Just a bit of luck,” disclaimed Don modestly.</p>

<p>“Was it just luck?” asked the captain
pointedly.</p>

<p>“Well, not exactly,” admitted Don. “The
fact is, I remembered the way King Cheops
concealed the opening into his tomb in the
Great Pyramid. I thought the same thing
might have been worked here, so I tried to
feel for it. But it was just luck I thought of
it.”</p>

<p>“Luck!” snorted the captain. “I call it
brain. And about the finest specimen of brain
I know of is in the headpiece of a certain young
fellow named Don Sturdy!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV<br>

<small><span class="smcap">The Sleepwalker</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Naturally</span>, there was one subject above all
others discussed that night as the explorers ate
their meal and later, when they lay about and
relaxed from the strain of the day.</p>

<p>But even more important than that was one
that the captain had with Don’s father, as he
drew the latter a little apart from the group
later in the evening.</p>

<p>“How are things shaping, Richard?” asked
the captain, laying his hand on his brother’s
arm with an affectionate gesture.</p>

<p>“I think I’m beginning to get matters in
their true relations,” replied Mr. Sturdy.
“The discovery to-day has done a lot toward
clearing things up. I don’t recall a thing as
yet about my voyage from Brazil to Egypt.
But I am beginning to remember some of the
things that have occurred since my reaching
here. I can dimly recall the faces of some of
the workmen I employed. It’s still rather
dreamlike, but it’s coming.”</p>

<p>“That’s great!” exclaimed the captain. “It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
won’t be long at this rate before the last haziness
will have vanished. But there is one thing
especially that I wish you would try to remember.
It’s a thing on which the lives of all of us
may depend. How did you get in here?”</p>

<p>Richard Sturdy closed his eyes and tried to
remember. But after a prolonged effort, he
opened his eyes and shook his head wearily.</p>

<p>“I can’t do it, Frank,” he said. “The sudden
blending of the recollections of Brazil with
those of Egypt has left me confused on some
points. I don’t yet remember anything of what
passed just before I found myself on the bank
of the stream.”</p>

<p>“Let me see if I can help you,” said his
brother. “You heard Don describe the way he
got in, or rather fell into, this place. Did you
come in that way?”</p>

<p>Richard Sturdy shook his head.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I didn’t,” he answered. “I’d
probably have some scratches and bruises to
show for it just as the boys have.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you recall the one rock balanced on
the other where we came in?” persisted the
captain.</p>

<p>“All Greek to me,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“I see,” said the captain. “Now, Richard,”
he went on solemnly, “the lives of all of us are
in your hands. Somewhere, somehow, you
found an entrance into this place. We’ve
searched for it in vain. Our provisions will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
last for only a short time longer. When they
are gone we shall starve. Try, Richard, try to
remember. Concentrate your mind on it.
Make a supreme effort.”</p>

<p>“I will,” promised Richard Sturdy, deeply
moved. “Oh, if my mind were what it used to
be! But I will make a desperate effort.”</p>

<p>“Good!” encouraged the captain. “In the
meantime we’ll call it a day and settle down to
sleep, so that you can think undisturbed.”</p>

<p>A quiet word to the others and the talk subsided,
and they stretched out in slumber.</p>

<p>But Richard Sturdy lay awake far into the
night cudgeling his brain in vain, and it was
only toward morning that he fell exhausted
into a deep sleep.</p>

<p>Just as the first faint streaks of dawn stole
into the chamber Don was awakened by the
captain’s hand on his arm and the captain’s
other hand on his lips.</p>

<p>“S—sh!” whispered his uncle, as Don sat up
in surprise.</p>

<p>Don followed the direction of his uncle’s
eyes, and saw that his father had risen, and
was standing in a somewhat strained and unnatural
attitude.</p>

<p>Richard Sturdy stood for a moment and
turned his face first to the right and then to the
left. Don caught a glimpse of his eyes, and
saw that they had an expressionless appearance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
almost as though they were made of
glass.</p>

<p>Then his father started off with the stiff
step of a soldier on parade, down one of the
passages that led off to the right. In an instant
the captain and Don were on their feet
and following him on tiptoe.</p>

<p>On Richard Sturdy went, until Don could
hear the faint falling of the water that had been
such a blessed boon to him the morning before.</p>

<p>His father followed the bank of the stream
until he came to a place where the little river
seemed to lose itself through a narrow passage
into a small mound of earth.</p>

<p>Without a moment’s hesitation, Mr. Sturdy
stepped into the stream, bent down until his
back was in almost a horizontal position, and
disappeared under the mound.</p>

<p>Don and the captain followed his example.
Their faces almost touched the water as they
bent down, but there was still room for them to
breathe.</p>

<p>A moment later, they emerged into an apartment
of about twenty feet in length and width.
At one side it sloped gently upward.</p>

<p>Richard Sturdy climbed the slope, bent over
and pushed away a heavy growth of bushes,
and a rush of light and fresh morning air
swept in from the outside world.</p>

<p>Don leaped into the air and was about to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
give utterance to a delighted whoop, but the
captain clapped his hand over his mouth.</p>

<p>“Not a sound,” he whispered. “We mustn’t
wake him.”</p>

<p>So Don, though in his glee he fairly ached to
shout and dance, was forced to restrain himself.</p>

<p>Richard Sturdy stood for a moment looking
outside. Then, with the same stiff, soldierly
stride, he passed the silent watchers, retraced
his steps, and sank down in his former place
with a deep drawn sigh.</p>

<p>Then and only then did the captain and Don
dare to give vent to their delight. They shook
hands vigorously, their faces beaming. Then
they wakened the others, and after cautioning
them about disturbing Mr. Sturdy, imparted
the joyous news that threw them all into a
delirium of rapture.</p>

<p>It was late when Don’s father awoke.</p>

<p>“No use, Frank,” he said sadly, as his eyes
encountered those of the captain. “I’ve tried
and tried, but I can’t think of the way I got in
here.”</p>

<p>The captain took his hand.</p>

<p>“You’ve already shown us, Richard,” he
said gently. “You thought about it so intently
last night that it came to you in your sleep and
you led us to it. We are saved, Richard, and
you are our savior.”</p>

<p>Then he narrated briefly and simply the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
events of the night. Mr. Sturdy was overwhelmed,
though in his joy there was a tincture
of embarrassment.</p>

<p>Apart altogether from the value of his service,
unconscious as it was, the fact that he had
saved the party was of immense benefit in helping
Don’s father to recover his mental balance.
Knowing dimly his infirmity, he had had a
sense of dependence, of uselessness, of inferiority,
and had felt that he was more or less of
a burden on the others. He feared to look into
the future. But the service he had done them
removed this feeling altogether, and from that
time on his progress was rapid.</p>

<p>They could now eat freely, not only of Mr.
Sturdy’s provisions, but Don and Teddy served
for communication with Ismillah and Abdul,
bringing in supplies daily, though taking the
utmost precautions to see that they were not
followed.</p>

<p>They were uneasy at learning, however, that
though the servants had not been molested in
their hidden retreat, they had frequently seen
a band of Bedouins ranging the vicinity,
headed by Tezra and Nepahak, both of whom
were known to Ismillah.</p>

<p>Don had recovered his own rifle, and on reporting
the facts gained from Ismillah, had
been directed by the captain to bring plenty of
ammunition from their store and enough rifles
to equip every member of the party.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>Nearly a week was required for the professor
and Zeta Phalos, with the assistance of the
others, to catalogue the treasures of the tomb
for submission to the Egyptian Government.
A great many of the most portable of these
were packed to carry along with them, as
proofs of their discovery.</p>

<p>On the night before they planned to leave,
they were engaged in an earnest conversation
about their future movements when once again
the horrible shriek brought them to their feet
and the dreadful figure, more frightful, it
seemed to them, than ever, seemed to move
threateningly toward them, its banshee wail
arousing a thousand echoes.</p>

<p>The captain reached for his gun and fired,
and the figure vanished.</p>

<p>“Come along!” called the captain, as he
seized a torch and rushed in that direction.
“We’ll settle this thing right here and now!”</p>

<p>The others, all except Phalos, followed with
torches and flashlights, and found the captain
standing on the brink of a chasm.</p>

<p>They looked over fearfully, and then the
captain broke into a gale of laughter.</p>

<p>“There’s your ghost!” he cried. “Look at
him!” and he pointed to a large platform made
of reeds and covered with a white sheet on
which some phosphorescent substance had been
daubed, hanging a little below the brink of the
chasm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>“And I winged him too with that shot,” the
captain chuckled, as he pointed to a broken
hinge, the brightly gleaming shattered edge of
which showed that the break had been recent.
“Come here, Phalos,” he shouted, “and look
at your ghost.”</p>

<p>The old Egyptian, reassured by the laughter,
came forward and looked rather sheepishly at
the discredited “ghost.”</p>

<p>“Simplicity itself,” declared the professor,
“and yet ingenious too. There’s no doubt the
thing was designed to frighten off intruders.
You see the thing is made of reeds, through
which the wind plays, something on the principle
of an Æolian harp, only in this case they
were so arranged as to produce discords instead
of harmonies. When the night wind
springs up, there’s a tremendous draught comes
up this funnel-like chasm, as you can tell by
putting your hand over the edge. When an unusually
heavy gust comes, it sends this thing
up into the air with its phosphorescent sheet
and other fixings.”</p>

<p>“But it will never fly up again,” cried the
captain. “I’ve broken one of its wings. Here
goes the other.”</p>

<p>His rifle cracked and the remaining hinge
snapped. There was a moment’s fluttering,
and then the whole hideous contraption sank
out of sight forever to the bottom of the abyss.</p>

<p>The next morning the explorers bade farewell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
to the Tombs of Golds, and passed out into
the open. It took them several hours to get
out their precious burdens, and several more
to get them packed on the extra camels they
had brought along for pack purposes.</p>

<p>They were making their way down the rocks
with the last consignment when a squad of
rough-looking riders, about a score in number,
came in sight from around a stony slope a
quarter of a mile away.</p>

<p>“Down!” cried the captain, setting the example.</p>

<p>The others sought to obey, but, encumbered
as they were by their burdens, could not do it
so quickly as to avoid detection.</p>

<p>That they had been seen was plain from the
actions of the riders, who pulled their mounts
to a sudden halt, and two or three of whom,
who appeared to be the leaders, gathered in
excited discussion.</p>

<p>Then, the conference at an end, the newcomers
rode on slowly and came to a pause at
the foot of the slope where the explorers had
chosen their position behind the rocks, not
more than two hundred feet away.</p>

<p>In the front, like birds of ill omen, rode Tezra
and Nepahak.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Don</span> was sheltered by a rock immediately adjoining
the one behind which his Uncle Frank
was lying, and he could hear the latter grit his
teeth as he caught sight of the two rascals.</p>

<p>“The spawn!” the captain muttered. “I’ll
have a crack at each of them before the day is
over.”</p>

<p>Tezra detached himself from the fierce-eyed,
hawk-nosed tribesmen that formed his lawless
following, and, waving a white cloth, advanced
toward the foot of the slope.</p>

<p>“I’d like to shoot it out of his hand,”
growled the captain.</p>

<p>But an envoy’s flag, even when held by a
scoundrel, is sacred, and the captain reluctantly
rose to his feet.</p>

<p>“Keep him covered,” he commanded, and
turned toward Tezra.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” he demanded curtly.</p>

<p>“A share of the treasure you have found,”
replied Tezra.</p>

<p>“I like your impudence,” returned the captain.
“On what ground?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>“Because we are the stronger,” was the
cynical avowal. “We are many and you are
few.”</p>

<p>“And if I refuse?”</p>

<p>“We will come and take it and wipe you
out.”</p>

<p>“And if I surrender it to you?”</p>

<p>“We will let you go with your lives.”</p>

<p>“Now listen to me, you scoundrel,” blazed
forth the captain. “My answer is ‘no’. A
thousand times, no! You can’t have anything
except over our dead bodies.”</p>

<p>“You are going to your death,” snarled
Tezra. “We are twenty to six. You have no
chance.”</p>

<p>“You and Nepahak will go with us then,”
retorted the captain. “You have my answer.
Come and take us.”</p>

<p>The discomfited envoy, with a scowl, returned
to his companions, and an animated debate
ensued.</p>

<p>Tezra and Nepahak, their red fezzes shining
brightly in the sun, could be seen moving here
and there, evidently urging a course of action
to which some of the others objected.</p>

<p>“I’m going to throw a scare into those fellows,”
declared the captain. “Don, do you see
that tassel at the side of Tezra’s fez?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Don, getting his rifle ready.</p>

<p>“Clip it,” the captain commanded. “I’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
take the button on the fez of Nepahak. Fire
when I give the word.”</p>

<p>They took careful aim.</p>

<p>“Fire!”</p>

<p>The shots rang out simultaneously. The button
was shorn neatly from Nepahak’s fez, and
the tassel fell from the side of the fez of Tezra
as though it had been clipped with shears.</p>

<p>A chorus of shouts went up from the tribesmen
and they threw themselves from their
mounts, crouching on the further side of
the animals for shelter. Tezra and Nepahak,
their faces blanched, quickly did the same.</p>

<p>“We could have sent those through your
heads just as easily,” shouted the captain,
“but we do not want your blood on our hands.”</p>

<p>That the marvelous shooting had had its effect
was evident from the long pause that ensued.
Don began to hope that the “bluff” had
succeeded.</p>

<p>But the hope of loot had been too long nourished
and the disparity in numbers was too
great for the robbers to abandon their project
so easily. It was unlikely that all of the little
forlorn hope of six were equally good marksmen.</p>

<p>Gradually the camels, under the prodding of
their hidden masters, began to move slowly toward
the base of the slope so as to diminish
the distance when the time came to charge. It
would have been easy to bring some of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
camels down, but the explorers stayed their
hands.</p>

<p>“They’re coming now!” exclaimed the captain,
as his practiced eye saw that they were
gathering for a rush. “Don’t show an inch
more of yourselves that you can help. Fire to
wound but not to kill, on this first rush. A man
put out of action counts for as much as a dead
one. Fire when I give the order, and then keep
on firing.”</p>

<p>A score of rifles suddenly appeared above
the camels’ backs, and a volley of bullets came
pattering against the rocks. Then, with a loud
shout, the Bedouins abandoned their shelters
and rushed forward, firing as they came.</p>

<p>“Fire!” cried the captain.</p>

<p>Six rifles cracked and each missile found a
mark. Don had picked out Nepahak, and
caught him in the leg. The captain sent a bullet
through Tezra’s shoulder. Mr. Sturdy
brought down the Bedouin chief. The others,
at such close range, could hardly miss, and they
did not.</p>

<p>The tribesmen wavered as they saw their
leaders go down. Another volley wrought
havoc in their ranks, and they broke and ran
to the shelter of their camels. No bullets pursued
them, as the explorers wanted to limit the
casualties as much as possible.</p>

<p>“Do you think they will rush us again, Uncle
Frank?” asked Don, as he reloaded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>“Not likely; though they may,” was the
reply. “And they may have reinforcements in
the vicinity who will be attracted by the sound
of the shooting. Hark! What’s that?”</p>

<p>There was the sound of a bugle in the distance,
and a few minutes later a squad of Egyptian
cavalry galloped up, a smart looking officer
riding at their head.</p>

<p>At the first bugle note, the unwounded tribesmen
mounted their camels and scurried away
as fast as their beasts could carry them.</p>

<p>The young officer swung himself from the
saddle and looked about at the wounded men,
who gave ample evidence that a skirmish had
occurred.</p>

<p>The Americans, accompanied by Phalos, advanced
to meet him. A short colloquy followed,
and the situation was cleared up satisfactorily.
The squad was a Government patrol sent out
to subdue lawless bands that had of late been
giving much trouble.</p>

<p>“You’ve done some of our work for us,” the
officer declared, as he supervised the work of
gathering up the bandits. None had been
killed, though some of the wounds were painful.</p>

<p>If looks could have killed, the party would
certainly have perished beneath the baleful
glances cast at them by Tezra and Nepahak,
who, shortly afterward, were sentenced to ten
years at hard labor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>The offer of the young officer to escort the
exploring party to Luxor was accepted, and
they reached the city with their precious
freight in safety. The dahabiyeh of Phalos
conveyed them to Cairo, and there they made
their report to the Egyptian Government,
which immediately set a guard about the tomb
of Ras-Ameses.</p>

<p>The announcement of the discovery to the
world created a tremendous sensation, and
honors were showered without stint on the discoverers.
The usual arrangement was made,
whereby a certain share of the treasures went
to the Government and the rest was equally
divided among the members of the party, making
every one of them rich beyond their
dreams.</p>

<p>But richer far to Don was his finding of his
father, a fact that he cabled at the first possible
moment to the wife and daughter waiting in
America. The delirious joy that the news
brought into the Hillville home was beyond expression.
Answering cables came, brimming
with happiness and affection, and urging the
voyagers to hasten home.</p>

<p>Teddy, too, had got in instant communication
with his father, and the answer received
removed all apprehension he might have had
as to his escapade.</p>

<p>“Guess that spanking has gone into the discard,”
he grinned, as he read his message.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
“Dad seems to think that his wandering boy is
the goods, after all.”</p>

<p>As Don reviewed the events of those stirring
weeks, he felt that he never again would meet
with such exciting adventures. But that he
was mistaken will be seen in the next book of
this series, entitled: “Don Sturdy Across the
North Pole; or, Cast Away in the Land of Ice.”</p>

<p>Their parting with Phalos was a cause of
keen regret to all of them, for they had learned
to regard the old Egyptian with the deepest affection.
The feeling was reciprocated, and he
bade them farewell with the greatest reluctance,
after making them promise that they
would make his villa their home on any future
visit to Egypt.</p>

<p>The voyage home was a swift and prosperous
one, and the reception they had when they
reached Hillville was one never to be forgotten.
It was a red letter day in that household when
Mr. Sturdy, almost wholly recovered, gathered
his wife and daughter in his arms. Happiness
had proved a wonderful tonic, and Mrs. Sturdy
was herself again while the roses were once
more blooming in Ruth’s cheeks.</p>

<p>A skillful surgeon found a way to cure Mr.
Sturdy utterly by removing a splinter of skull
that had been pressing on the brain, and then
indeed the Sturdy home became an earthly
paradise.</p>

<p>Don’s exploits made him a hero with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
other members of the household, Dan and Mrs.
Roscoe and Jennie, whose delight at the return
of the adventurers was only less keen than that
of Ruth and Mrs. Sturdy. Jennie, especially,
threatened to create a scarcity in the gum market,
as she vigorously worked her jaws while
listening with delicious shivers to the story of
his wanderings in the tomb of the monarch,
whom she persisted in calling “Ras-Paresis.”</p>

<p>Don shone with an added luster also in the
eyes of Fred and Emily Turner. But he laughingly
evaded the pedestal on which they sought
to place him.</p>

<p>“It’s dad who deserves all the credit,” he
said. “I only fell into the Tombs of Gold. It
was dad who led us out.”</p>

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
